--**--**--
 "You're very good to say so, sir, and I'm not unthankful. But"--Adam
 continued, in a decided tone--"I shouldn't like to make any offers
 to Mr. Burge, or t' have any made for me. I see no clear road to a
 partnership. If he should ever want to dispose of the business, that 'ud
 be a different matter. I should be glad of some money at a fair interest
 then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in time."
 
 "Very well, Adam," said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine had said
 about a probable hitch in the love-making between Adam and Mary Burge,
 "we'll say no more about it at present. When is your father to be
 buried?"
 
 "On Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwine's coming earlier on purpose. I shall be glad
 when it's over, for I think my mother 'ull perhaps get easier then. It
 cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people; they've no way o' working
 it off, and the new spring brings no new shoots out on the withered
 tree."
 
 "Ah, you've had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life, Adam.
 I don't think you've ever been hare-brained and light-hearted, like
 other youngsters. You've always had some care on your mind."
 
 "Why, yes, sir; but that's nothing to make a fuss about. If we're men
 and have men's feelings, I reckon we must have men's troubles. We can't
 be like the birds, as fly from their nest as soon as they've got their
 wings, and never know their kin when they see 'em, and get a fresh lot
 every year. I've had enough to be thankful for: I've allays had health
 and strength and brains to give me a delight in my work; and I count it
 a great thing as I've had Bartle Massey's night-school to go to. He's
--**--**--
 "Then mind you fall in love in the right place, and don't get a wife who
 will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself. My
 mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says, 'I
 ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he falls
 in love with.' She thinks your lady-love will rule you as the moon rules
 the tides. But I feel bound to stand up for you, as my pupil you know,
 and I maintain that you're not of that watery quality. So mind you don't
 disgrace my judgment."
 
 Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine's opinion
 about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen. This, to be
 sure, was only another reason for persevering in his intention, and
 getting an additional security against himself. Nevertheless, at this
 point in the conversation, he was conscious of increased disinclination
 to tell his story about Hetty. He was of an impressible nature, and
 lived a great deal in other people's opinions and feelings concerning
 himself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate
 friend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such
 serious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own
 belief in the seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a
 thing to make a fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him that he
 could not do for himself? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg's
 lameness--go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he could on the
 old hack. That was his thought as he sugared his coffee; but the
 next minute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he remembered how
--**--**--
 small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion of
 the large obvious ones. Possibly there was some such unrecognized agent
 secretly busy in Arthur's mind at this moment--possibly it was the fear
 lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession to the
 rector a serious annoyance, in case he should NOT be able quite to carry
 out his good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was not so. The
 human soul is a very complex thing.
 
 The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine's mind as he looked
 inquiringly at Arthur, but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed
 the thought which had quickly followed--that there could be nothing
 serious in that direction. There was no probability that Arthur ever saw
 her except at church, and at her own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser;
 and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no more
 serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to rouse the
 little chit's vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her
 life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far away: no, there
 could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur's character had not
 been a strong security against it. His honest, patronizing pride in
 the good-will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even
 against foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of folly.
 If there had been anything special on Arthur's mind in the previous
 conversation, it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details,
 and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity. He
 perceived a change of subject would be welcome, and said, "By the way,
 Arthur, at your colonel's birthday fete there were some transparencies
--**--**--
 ugly people!"
 
 But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I
 hope? I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have
 not been ugly, and even among those "lords of their kind," the British,
 squat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and dingy complexions are not
 startling exceptions. Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst
 us. I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the
 Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; yet
 to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their
 miniatures--flattering, but still not lovely--are kissed in secret by
 motherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have
 never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of
 yellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered
 kisses on her sallow cheeks. And I believe there have been plenty of
 young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite
 sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana, and
 yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who
 waddles. Yes! Thank God; human feeling is like the mighty rivers that
 bless the earth: it does not wait for beauty--it flows with resistless
 force and brings beauty with it.
 
 All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate
 it to the utmost in men, women, and children--in our gardens and in our
 houses. But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret
 of proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an
 angel, if you can, with a floating violet robe, and a face paled by the
--**--**--
 the way in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is
 lovable--the way I have learnt something of its deep pathos, its sublime
 mysteries--has been by living a great deal among people more or less
 commonplace and vulgar, of whom you would perhaps hear nothing very
 surprising if you were to inquire about them in the neighbourhoods where
 they dwelt. Ten to one most of the small shopkeepers in their vicinity
 saw nothing at all in them. For I have observed this remarkable
 coincidence, that the select natures who pant after the ideal, and
 find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to command their
 reverence and love, are curiously in unison with the narrowest and
 pettiest. For example, I have often heard Mr. Gedge, the landlord of
 the Royal Oak, who used to turn a bloodshot eye on his neighbours in
 the village of Shepperton, sum up his opinion of the people in his own
 parish--and they were all the people he knew--in these emphatic words:
 "Aye, sir, I've said it often, and I'll say it again, they're a poor lot
 i' this parish--a poor lot, sir, big and little." I think he had a
 dim idea that if he could migrate to a distant parish, he might find
 neighbours worthy of him; and indeed he did subsequently transfer
 himself to the Saracen's Head, which was doing a thriving business in
 the back street of a neighbouring market-town. But, oddly enough, he has
 found the people up that back street of precisely the same stamp as the
 inhabitants of Shepperton--"a poor lot, sir, big and little, and them
 as comes for a go o' gin are no better than them as comes for a pint o'
 twopenny--a poor lot."
 
 
 
 Chapter XVIII
 
 Church
 
 
 "HETTY, Hetty, don't you know church begins at two, and it's gone half
--**--**--
 Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a
 speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going
 to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and "Whissuntide." But he had
 a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies,
 like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had
 leisure.
 
 "There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate," said Martin Poyser. "I
 reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he
 has, and him turned seventy-five."
 
 "Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,"
 said Mrs. Poyser; "they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're
 looking at. It's God A'mighty's way o' quietening 'em, I reckon, afore
 they go to sleep."
 
 Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching,
 and held it wide open, leaning on his stick--pleased to do this bit
 of work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he
 liked to feel that he was still useful--that there was a better crop of
 onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing--and that the cows
 would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon
 to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very
 regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of
 rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead.
 
 "They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the
 churchyard," he said, as his son came up. "It 'ud ha' been better luck
 if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin';
 there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a boat
--**--**--
 their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two,
 though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the
 churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like
 Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling
 as women feel in that position--that nothing else can be expected of
 them.
 
 It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were
 standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was
 their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at
 once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over
 the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's
 stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as
 far preferable--about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to
 wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year,
 and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could
 see her--about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was
 giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to
 his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman,
 and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the
 men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had
 a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church
 until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature
 entrance--what could they do in church if they were there before service
 began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe
 could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about
 "bus'ness."
 
 Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got
--**--**--
 rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church
 service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness
 of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our
 moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the
 best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and
 resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts
 of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of
 its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could
 have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their
 childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have
 seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the
 streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but
 in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes
 the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to
 discern odours.
 
 But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the
 service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village
 nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the
 slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where
 that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery
 even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it
 chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest
 conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls
 before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical
 ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to
--**--**--
 hand before their parting, and say, "Father, you know it was all right
 between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive
 me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!" Adam thought but
 little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his
 father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had
 been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before
 the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive
 silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own
 generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger
 has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the
 last time in the meekness of death!
 
 "Ah! I was always too hard," Adam said to himself. "It's a sore fault in
 me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and
 my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive
 'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I
 could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than
 bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride
 and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in
 what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I
 ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's
 allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough
 job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against
--**--**--
 and it'll be a nice job to mend it--there'll want a bit o' turning.
 You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?"
 
 Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see
 where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not
 without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about
 her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white
 hot-house plant, with a very long name--a Scotch name, she supposed,
 since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the
 opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of
 him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression
 on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her
 secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps
 learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she
 cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be
 given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond
 of giving information.
 
 Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were
 received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits
 is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of
 us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble
 understanding--it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,
 Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth
 year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and
 bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little
 heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty
--**--**--
 in raptures with it, and fall through all the gradations of melancholy
 longing till her husband promised to buy it for her. Adam pictured to
 himself Mrs. Poyser examining it with her keen eye and trying in vain to
 find out a deficiency; and, of course, close to Mrs. Poyser stood Hetty,
 and Adam was again beguiled from calculations and contrivances into
 dreams and hopes. Yes, he would go and see her this evening--it was so
 long since he had been at the Hall Farm. He would have liked to go
 to the night-school, to see why Bartle Massey had not been at church
 yesterday, for he feared his old friend was ill; but, unless he could
 manage both visits, this last must be put off till to-morrow--the desire
 to be near Hetty and to speak to her again was too strong.
 
 As he made up his mind to this, he was coming very near to the end of
 his walk, within the sound of the hammers at work on the refitting of
 the old house. The sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his work
 is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who
 has to bear his part in the overture: the strong fibres begin their
 accustomed thrill, and what was a moment before joy, vexation, or
 ambition, begins its change into energy. All passion becomes strength
 when it has an outlet from the narrow limits of our personal lot in the
 labour of our right arm, the cunning of our right hand, or the still,
 creative activity of our thought. Look at Adam through the rest of the
 day, as he stands on the scaffolding with the two-feet ruler in
 his hand, whistling low while he considers how a difficulty about a
--**--**--
 of Adam's words, "and' who likes to see thee i' thy best cloose better
 nor thy mother? An' when thee'st got thy face washed as clean as
 the smooth white pibble, an' thy hair combed so nice, and thy eyes
 a-sparklin'--what else is there as thy old mother should like to look at
 half so well? An' thee sha't put on thy Sunday cloose when thee lik'st
 for me--I'll ne'er plague thee no moor about'n."
 
 "Well, well; good-bye, mother," said Adam, kissing her and hurrying
 away. He saw there was no other means of putting an end to the dialogue.
 Lisbeth stood still on the spot, shading her eyes and looking after him
 till he was quite out of sight. She felt to the full all the meaning
 that had lain in Adam's words, and, as she lost sight of him and turned
 back slowly into the house, she said aloud to herself--for it was her
 way to speak her thoughts aloud in the long days when her husband and
 sons were at their work--"Eh, he'll be tellin' me as he's goin' to bring
 her home one o' these days; an' she'll be missis o'er me, and I mun
 look on, belike, while she uses the blue-edged platters, and breaks
 'em, mayhap, though there's ne'er been one broke sin' my old man an' me
 bought 'em at the fair twenty 'ear come next Whissuntide. Eh!" she went
 on, still louder, as she caught up her knitting from the table, "but
 she'll ne'er knit the lad's stockin's, nor foot 'em nayther, while I
 live; an' when I'm gone, he'll bethink him as nobody 'ull ne'er fit's
 leg an' foot as his old mother did. She'll know nothin' o' narrowin' an'
 heelin', I warrand, an' she'll make a long toe as he canna get's boot
--**--**--
 get there in nine or ten hours, I'll be bound, he's such a rider. And I
 shouldn't wonder if he's back again to-morrow; he's too active to rest
 long in that lonely place, all by himself, for there's nothing but a
 bit of a inn i' that part where he's gone to fish. I wish he'd got th'
 estate in his hands; that 'ud be the right thing for him, for it 'ud
 give him plenty to do, and he'd do't well too, for all he's so young;
 he's got better notions o' things than many a man twice his age. He
 spoke very handsome to me th' other day about lending me money to set up
 i' business; and if things came round that way, I'd rather be beholding
 to him nor to any man i' the world."
 
 Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty
 would be pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend
 him; the fact entered into his future prospects, which he would like to
 seem promising in her eyes. And it was true that Hetty listened with an
 interest which brought a new light into her eyes and a half-smile upon
 her lips.
 
 "How pretty the roses are now!" Adam continued, pausing to look at them.
 "See! I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it myself. I think
 these as are all pink, and have got a finer sort o' green leaves, are
 prettier than the striped uns, don't you?"
 
 He set down the basket and took the rose from his button-hole.
 
 "It smells very sweet," he said; "those striped uns have no smell. Stick
 it in your frock, and then you can put it in water after. It 'ud be a
--**--**--
 to Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of
 propriety, and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated
 sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her. That
 would not be fair-play: every woman was young in her turn, and had her
 chances of matrimony, which it was a point of honour for other women not
 to spoil--just as one market-woman who has sold her own eggs must not
 try to balk another of a customer.
 
 Hetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an answer to
 her aunt's question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and
 Tommy and bring them in to supper.
 
 Soon they were all seated--the two rosy lads, one on each side, by the
 pale mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle.
 Alick too was come in, and was seated in his far corner, eating cold
 broad beans out of a large dish with his pocket-knife, and finding
 a flavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest
 pineapple.
 
 "What a time that gell is drawing th' ale, to be sure!" said Mrs.
 Poyser, when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine. "I think
 she sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap, as there's nothing
 you can't believe o' them wenches: they'll set the empty kettle o' the
 fire, and then come an hour after to see if the water boils."
 
 "She's drawin' for the men too," said Mr. Poyser. "Thee shouldst ha'
 told her to bring our jug up first."
 
 "Told her?" said Mrs. Poyser. "Yes, I might spend all the wind i' my
 body, an' take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells everything
--**--**--
 that he began to cry; and the good-natured father, indulgent to all
 weaknesses but those of negligent farmers, said to Hetty, "You'd better
 take the things off again, my lass; it hurts your aunt to see 'em."
 
 Hetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable
 diversion; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap, which could
 not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser; and then followed
 a discussion on the secrets of good brewing, the folly of stinginess in
 "hopping," and the doubtful economy of a farmer's making his own malt.
 Mrs. Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with
 weight on these subjects that by the time supper was ended, the ale-jug
 refilled, and Mr. Poyser's pipe alight she was once more in high good
 humour, and ready, at Adam's request, to fetch the broken spinning-wheel
 for his inspection.
 
 "Ah," said Adam, looking at it carefully, "here's a nice bit o' turning
 wanted. It's a pretty wheel. I must have it up at the turning-shop in
 the village and do it there, for I've no convenence for turning at home.
 If you'll send it to Mr. Burge's shop i' the morning, I'll get it
 done for you by Wednesday. I've been turning it over in my mind," he
 continued, looking at Mr. Poyser, "to make a bit more convenence at home
 for nice jobs o' cabinet-making. I've always done a deal at such
 little things in odd hours, and they're profitable, for there's more
 workmanship nor material in 'em. I look for me and Seth to get a little
 business for ourselves i' that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as 'ull
 take as many things as we should make, besides what we could get orders
--**--**--
 got an overlooker's place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who sawed with
 him, had learned to read when he was turned twenty, and what could be
 done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered, could
 be done by himself, seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay if
 circumstances required it. So here he was, pointing his big finger
 towards three words at once, and turning his head on one side that he
 might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be
 discriminated out of the group. The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey
 must possess was something so dim and vast that Bill's imagination
 recoiled before it: he would hardly have ventured to deny that the
 schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular
 return of daylight and the changes in the weather.
 
 The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he was a
 Methodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his life in
 perfect satisfaction with his ignorance, had lately "got religion," and
 along with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him, too, learning
 was a heavy business, and on his way out to-night he had offered as
 usual a special prayer for help, seeing that he had undertaken this hard
 task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul--that he might
 have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish evil
 memories and the temptations of old habit--or, in brief language,
 the devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was
 suspected, though there was no good evidence against him, of being the
 man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that
 might be, it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to,
--**--**--
 houses, though, in that period of spider-legs and inlaid cupids, Bartle
 had got them for an old song, where as free from dust as things could be
 at the end of a summer's day.
 
 "Now, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. We'll not talk about business till
 we've had our supper. No man can be wise on an empty stomach. But," said
 Bartle, rising from his chair again, "I must give Vixen her supper
 too, confound her! Though she'll do nothing with it but nourish those
 unnecessary babbies. That's the way with these women--they've got no
 head-pieces to nourish, and so their food all runs either to fat or to
 brats."
 
 He brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at once fixed
 her eyes on, and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the utmost
 dispatch.
 
 "I've had my supper, Mr. Massey," said Adam, "so I'll look on while you
 eat yours. I've been at the Hall Farm, and they always have their supper
 betimes, you know: they don't keep your late hours."
 
 "I know little about their hours," said Bartle dryly, cutting his bread
 and not shrinking from the crust. "It's a house I seldom go into, though
 I'm fond of the boys, and Martin Poyser's a good fellow. There's too
 many women in the house for me: I hate the sound of women's voices;
 they're always either a-buzz or a-squeak--always either a-buzz or
 a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top o' the talk like a fife; and
 as for the young lasses, I'd as soon look at water-grubs. I know what
 they'll turn to--stinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my
 boy: it's been drawn for you--it's been drawn for you."
 
 "Nay, Mr. Massey," said Adam, who took his old friend's whim more
--**--**--
 
 "Aye, aye," said Adam, striding along towards the streak of pale road.
 He was the only object moving on the wide common. The two grey donkeys,
 just visible in front of the gorse bushes, stood as still as limestone
 images--as still as the grey-thatched roof of the mud cottage a little
 farther on. Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed into
 the darkness, while Vixen, in a state of divided affection, had twice
 run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her puppies.
 
 "Aye, aye," muttered the schoolmaster, as Adam disappeared, "there you
 go, stalking along--stalking along; but you wouldn't have been what you
 are if you hadn't had a bit of old lame Bartle inside you. The strongest
 calf must have something to suck at. There's plenty of these big,
 lumbering fellows 'ud never have known their A B C if it hadn't been for
 Bartle Massey. Well, well, Vixen, you foolish wench, what is it, what is
 it? I must go in, must I? Aye, aye, I'm never to have a will o' my own
 any more. And those pups--what do you think I'm to do with 'em, when
 they're twice as big as you? For I'm pretty sure the father was that
 hulking bull-terrier of Will Baker's--wasn't he now, eh, you sly hussy?"
 
 (Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran forward into the
 house. Subjects are sometimes broached which a well-bred female will
 ignore.)
 
 "But where's the use of talking to a woman with babbies?" continued
 Bartle. "She's got no conscience--no conscience; it's all run to milk."

 Going to the Birthday Feast
 
 
 THE thirtieth of July was come, and it was one of those half-dozen warm
 days which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer. No

 prejudices, as much as if you were studying the psychology of a canary
 bird, and only watch the movements of this pretty round creature as she
 turns her head on one side with an unconscious smile at the ear-rings
 nestled in the little box. Ah, you think, it is for the sake of the
 person who has given them to her, and her thoughts are gone back now to
 the moment when they were put into her hands. No; else why should she
 have cared to have ear-rings rather than anything else? And I know that
 she had longed for ear-rings from among all the ornaments she could
 imagine.
 
 "Little, little ears!" Arthur had said, pretending to pinch them one
 evening, as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat. "I wish I
 had some pretty ear-rings!" she said in a moment, almost before she knew
 what she was saying--the wish lay so close to her lips, it WOULD flutter
 past them at the slightest breath. And the next day--it was only last
 week--Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them. That
 little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of
 childishness; he had never heard anything like it before; and he had
 wrapped the box up in a great many covers, that he might see Hetty
 unwrapping it with growing curiosity, till at last her eyes flashed back
 their new delight into his.
 
 No, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the
 ear-rings, for now she is taking them out of the box, not to press them
 to her lips, but to fasten them in her ears--only for one moment, to
 see how pretty they look, as she peeps at them in the glass against
--**--**--
 towards evening, but drunkenness and darkness go better together than
 drunkenness and daylight."
 
 "Well, I hope there won't be much of it. I've kept the Treddleston
 people away by having a feast for them in the town; and I've got Casson
 and Adam Bede and some other good fellows to look to the giving out of
 ale in the booths, and to take care things don't go too far. Come, let
 us go up above now and see the dinner-tables for the large tenants."
 
 They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery
 above the cloisters, a gallery where all the dusty worthless old
 pictures had been banished for the last three generations--mouldy
 portraits of Queen Elizabeth and her ladies, General Monk with his eye
 knocked out, Daniel very much in the dark among the lions, and Julius
 Caesar on horseback, with a high nose and laurel crown, holding his
 Commentaries in his hand.
 
 "What a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old
 abbey!" said Arthur. "If I'm ever master here, I shall do up the gallery
 in first-rate style. We've got no room in the house a third as large
 as this. That second table is for the farmers' wives and children: Mrs.
 Best said it would be more comfortable for the mothers and children
 to be by themselves. I was determined to have the children, and make a
 regular family thing of it. I shall be 'the old squire' to those little
 lads and lasses some day, and they'll tell their children what a much
 finer young fellow I was than my own son. There's a table for the women
 and children below as well. But you will see them all--you will come up
 with me after dinner, I hope?"
--**--**--
 
 Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the
 table, fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too much
 occupied with the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed his
 entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen, considered Adam "rather lifted up
 and peppery-like": he thought the gentry made more fuss about this
 young carpenter than was necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson,
 although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years.
 
 "Well, Mr. Bede, you're one o' them as mounts hup'ards apace," he said,
 when Adam sat down. "You've niver dined here before, as I remember."
 
 "No, Mr. Casson," said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard
 along the table; "I've never dined here before, but I come by Captain
 Donnithorne's wish, and I hope it's not disagreeable to anybody here."
 
 "Nay, nay," said several voices at once, "we're glad ye're come. Who's
 got anything to say again' it?"
 
 "And ye'll sing us 'Over the hills and far away,' after dinner, wonna
 ye?" said Mr. Chowne. "That's a song I'm uncommon fond on."
 
 "Peeh!" said Mr. Craig; "it's not to be named by side o' the Scotch
 tunes. I've never cared about singing myself; I've had something better
 to do. A man that's got the names and the natur o' plants in's head isna
 likely to keep a hollow place t' hold tunes in. But a second cousin o'
 mine, a drovier, was a rare hand at remembering the Scotch tunes. He'd
 got nothing else to think on."
 
 "The Scotch tunes!" said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; "I've heard
 enough o' the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. They're fit for
 nothing but to frighten the birds with--that's to say, the English
 birds, for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I know. Give the
--**--**--
 right thing, and to leave the world a bit better than he found it, which
 it's my belief every man may do, whether he's gentle or simple, whether
 he sets a good bit o' work going and finds the money, or whether he does
 the work with his own hands. There's no occasion for me to say any more
 about what I feel towards him: I hope to show it through the rest o' my
 life in my actions."
 
 There were various opinions about Adam's speech: some of the women
 whispered that he didn't show himself thankful enough, and seemed to
 speak as proud as could be; but most of the men were of opinion that
 nobody could speak more straightfor'ard, and that Adam was as fine a
 chap as need to be. While such observations were being buzzed about,
 mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a
 bailiff, and whether he was going to have a steward, the two gentlemen
 had risen, and were walking round to the table where the wives and
 children sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but
 wine and dessert--sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good
 sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and
 Totty was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into a
 wine-glass in search of the nuts floating there.
 
 "How do you do, Mrs. Poyser?" said Arthur. "Weren't you pleased to hear
 your husband make such a good speech to-day?"
 
 "Oh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tied--you're forced partly to
 guess what they mean, as you do wi' the dumb creaturs."
 
 "What! you think you could have made it better for him?" said Mr.
 Irwine, laughing.
--**--**--
 Poyser. "A woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to
 be neglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her
 knee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?"
 
 "That is Hetty Sorrel," said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, "Martin Poyser's
 niece--a very likely young person, and well-looking too. My maid has
 taught her fine needlework, and she has mended some lace of mine very
 respectably indeed--very respectably."
 
 "Why, she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years, Mother; you
 must have seen her," said Miss Irwine.
 
 "No, I've never seen her, child--at least not as she is now," said Mrs.
 Irwine, continuing to look at Hetty. "Well-looking, indeed! She's a
 perfect beauty! I've never seen anything so pretty since my young days.
 What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the farmers,
 when it's wanted so terribly among the good families without fortune!
 I daresay, now, she'll marry a man who would have thought her just as
 pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair."
 
 Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was
 speaking of her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with
 something on the opposite side. But he saw her plainly enough without
 looking; saw her in heightened beauty, because he heard her beauty
 praised--for other men's opinion, you know, was like a native climate
 to Arthur's feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and
 grew strong. Yes! She was enough to turn any man's head: any man in his
 place would have done and felt the same. And to give her up after all,
 as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always look
 back upon with pride.
--**--**--
 by hisses, while the boys applied the argument of sticks. But the
 strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the
 arguments urged, which, well considered, requires as great a mental
 force as the direct sequence; and the present donkey proved the
 first-rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill
 just when the blows were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd,
 radiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate
 rider of this superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the
 midst of its triumph.
 
 Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill was made
 happy with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with blades and gimlets
 enough to make a man at home on a desert island. He had hardly returned
 from the marquee with the prize in his hand, when it began to be
 understood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company, before
 the gentry went to dinner, with an impromptu and gratuitous
 performance--namely, a hornpipe, the main idea of which was doubtless
 borrowed; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and
 complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality.
 Wiry Ben's pride in his dancing--an accomplishment productive of great
 effect at the yearly Wake--had needed only slightly elevating by an
 extra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be
 very much struck with his performance of his hornpipe; and he had been
 decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann, who observed that it
 was nothing but right to do something to please the young squire, in
 return for what he had done for them. You will be the less surprised
 at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had
--**--**--
 
 "Nonsense!" said Mr. Poyser. "Why, everybody's goin' to dance to-night,
 all but th' old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Best's been tellin' us as
 Miss Lyddy and Miss Irwine 'ull dance, an' the young squire 'ull pick
 my wife for his first partner, t' open the ball: so she'll be forced to
 dance, though she's laid by ever sin' the Christmas afore the little un
 was born. You canna for shame stand still, Adam, an' you a fine young
 fellow and can dance as well as anybody."
 
 "Nay, nay," said Mrs. Poyser, "it 'ud be unbecomin'. I know the dancin's
 nonsense, but if you stick at everything because it's nonsense, you
 wonna go far i' this life. When your broth's ready-made for you, you mun
 swallow the thickenin', or else let the broth alone."
 
 "Then if Hetty 'ull dance with me," said Adam, yielding either to Mrs.
 Poyser's argument or to something else, "I'll dance whichever dance
 she's free."
 
 "I've got no partner for the fourth dance," said Hetty; "I'll dance that
 with you, if you like."
 
 "Ah," said Mr. Poyser, "but you mun dance the first dance, Adam, else
 it'll look partic'ler. There's plenty o' nice partners to pick an'
 choose from, an' it's hard for the gells when the men stan' by and don't
 ask 'em."
 
 Adam felt the justice of Mr. Poyser's observation: it would not do for
 him to dance with no one besides Hetty; and remembering that Jonathan
 Burge had some reason to feel hurt to-day, he resolved to ask Miss Mary
 to dance with him the first dance, if she had no other partner.
 
 "There's the big clock strikin' eight," said Mr. Poyser; "we must make
 haste in now, else the squire and the ladies 'ull be in afore us, an'
 that wouldna look well."

 A crisis
 
 
 IT was beyond the middle of August--nearly three weeks after the
 birthday feast. The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland
 county of Loamshire, but the harvest was likely still to be retarded
 by the heavy rains, which were causing inundations and much damage
 throughout the country. From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope
 farmers, on their pleasant uplands and in their brook-watered
 valleys, had not suffered, and as I cannot pretend that they were such
 exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own,
 you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid
 rise in the price of bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in
 their own corn undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying
 winds flattered this hope.
 
 The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked
 brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before. Grand masses of
 cloud were hurried across the blue, and the great round hills behind the
 Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows; the sun was hidden for a
 moment, and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy; the leaves,
 still green, were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind; around the
 farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors; the apples fell in the
 orchards; and the stray horses on the green sides of the lanes and on
 the common had their manes blown about their faces. And yet the wind
 seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun was shining. A
 merry day for the children, who ran and shouted to see if they could
 top the wind with their voices; and the grown-up people too were in
 good spirits, inclined to believe in yet finer days, when the wind had

 is, for then she's not likely to deceive herself."
 
 "I don't know what you mean by flirting," said Adam, "but if you mean
 behaving to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving her all
 the while, I say that's not th' action of an honest man, and what isn't
 honest does come t' harm. I'm not a fool, and you're not a fool, and you
 know better than what you're saying. You know it couldn't be made
 public as you've behaved to Hetty as y' have done without her losing her
 character and bringing shame and trouble on her and her relations. What
 if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents? Other folks
 won't believe as you've meant nothing; and don't tell me about her not
 deceiving herself. I tell you as you've filled her mind so with the
 thought of you as it'll mayhap poison her life, and she'll never love
 another man as 'ud make her a good husband."
 
 Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he perceived
 that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and that there was no
 irrevocable damage done by this evening's unfortunate rencontre. Adam
 could still be deceived. The candid Arthur had brought himself into a
 position in which successful lying was his only hope. The hope allayed
 his anger a little.
 
 "Well, Adam," he said, in a tone of friendly concession, "you're perhaps
 right. Perhaps I've gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty
 little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You're such a grave,
 steady fellow, you don't understand the temptation to such trifling.
 I'm sure I wouldn't bring any trouble or annoyance on her and the good
 Poysers on any account if I could help it. But I think you look a little
--**--**--
 voice.
 
 Arthur put his hand up to his waistcoat buttons, and when Adam had
 unbuttoned it, he took a longer breath. "Lay my head down," he said,
 faintly, "and get me some water if you can."
 
 Adam laid the head down gently on the fern again, and emptying the tools
 out of the flag-basket, hurried through the trees to the edge of the
 Grove bordering on the Chase, where a brook ran below the bank.
 
 When he returned with his basket leaking, but still half-full, Arthur
 looked at him with a more thoroughly reawakened consciousness.
 
 "Can you drink a drop out o' your hand, sir?" said Adam, kneeling down
 again to lift up Arthur's head.
 
 "No," said Arthur, "dip my cravat in and souse it on my head."
 
 The water seemed to do him some good, for he presently raised himself a
 little higher, resting on Adam's arm.
 
 "Do you feel any hurt inside sir?" Adam asked again
 
 "No--no hurt," said Arthur, still faintly, "but rather done up."
 
 After a while he said, "I suppose I fainted away when you knocked me
 down."
 
 "Yes, sir, thank God," said Adam. "I thought it was worse."
 
 "What! You thought you'd done for me, eh? Come help me on my legs."
 
 "I feel terribly shaky and dizzy," Arthur said, as he stood leaning
 on Adam's arm; "that blow of yours must have come against me like a
 battering-ram. I don't believe I can walk alone."
 
 "Lean on me, sir; I'll get you along," said Adam. "Or, will you sit down
 a bit longer, on my coat here, and I'll prop y' up. You'll perhaps be
 better in a minute or two."
 
 "No," said Arthur. "I'll go to the Hermitage--I think I've got some
 brandy there. There's a short road to it a little farther on, near the
--**--**--
 joy I could have now, to think the best of you."
 
 Arthur wanted to go home without saying any more--he was too painfully
 embarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to wish for any
 further explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to him that Adam
 reopened the subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer.
 Arthur was in the wretched position of an open, generous man who has
 committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity. The native
 impulse to give truth in return for truth, to meet trust with frank
 confession, must be suppressed, and duty was becoming a question of
 tactics. His deed was reacting upon him--was already governing him
 tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual
 feelings. The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive
 Adam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him than he deserved.
 And when he heard the words of honest retractation--when he heard the
 sad appeal with which Adam ended--he was obliged to rejoice in
 the remains of ignorant confidence it implied. He did not answer
 immediately, for he had to be judicious and not truthful.
 
 "Say no more about our anger, Adam," he said, at last, very languidly,
 for the labour of speech was unwelcome to him; "I forgive your momentary
 injustice--it was quite natural, with the exaggerated notions you had in
 your mind. We shall be none the worse friends in future, I hope, because
 we've fought. You had the best of it, and that was as it should be, for
 I believe I've been most in the wrong of the two. Come, let us shake
 hands."
 
 Arthur held out his hand, but Adam sat still.
 
 "I don't like to say 'No' to that, sir," he said, "but I can't shake

 into the house.
 
 
 
 Chapter XXIX
 
 The Next Morning
 
 
 ARTHUR did not pass a sleepless night; he slept long and well. For sleep
 comes to the perplexed--if the perplexed are only weary enough. But at
 seven he rang his bell and astonished Pym by declaring he was going to
 get up, and must have breakfast brought to him at eight.
 
 "And see that my mare is saddled at half-past eight, and tell my
 grandfather when he's down that I'm better this morning and am gone for
 a ride."
 
 He had been awake an hour, and could rest in bed no longer. In bed our
 yesterdays are too oppressive: if a man can only get up, though it
 be but to whistle or to smoke, he has a present which offers some
 resistance to the past--sensations which assert themselves against
 tyrannous memories. And if there were such a thing as taking averages
 of feeling, it would certainly be found that in the hunting and shooting
 seasons regret, self-reproach, and mortified pride weigh lighter on
 country gentlemen than in late spring and summer. Arthur felt that he
 should be more of a man on horseback. Even the presence of Pym, waiting
 on him with the usual deference, was a reassurance to him after the
 scenes of yesterday. For, with Arthur's sensitiveness to opinion,
 the loss of Adam's respect was a shock to his self-contentment which
 suffused his imagination with the sense that he had sunk in all eyes--as
 a sudden shock of fear from some real peril makes a nervous woman afraid
 even to step, because all her perceptions are suffused with a sense of
 danger.
 
 Arthur's, as you know, was a loving nature. Deeds of kindness were as
 easy to him as a bad habit: they were the common issue of his weaknesses
--**--**--
 to write it; he was not doing anything easy to himself; and this
 last thought helped him to arrive at a conclusion. He could never
 deliberately have taken a step which inflicted pain on another and left
 himself at ease. Even a movement of jealousy at the thought of giving up
 Hetty to Adam went to convince him that he was making a sacrifice.
 
 When once he had come to this conclusion, he turned Meg round and set
 off home again in a canter. The letter should be written the first
 thing, and the rest of the day would be filled up with other business:
 he should have no time to look behind him. Happily, Irwine and Gawaine
 were coming to dinner, and by twelve o'clock the next day he should
 have left the Chase miles behind him. There was some security in this
 constant occupation against an uncontrollable impulse seizing him to
 rush to Hetty and thrust into her hand some mad proposition that would
 undo everything. Faster and faster went the sensitive Meg, at every
 slight sign from her rider, till the canter had passed into a swift
 gallop.
 
 "I thought they said th' young mester war took ill last night," said
 sour old John, the groom, at dinner-time in the servants' hall. "He's
 been ridin' fit to split the mare i' two this forenoon."
 
 "That's happen one o' the symptims, John," said the facetious coachman.
 
 "Then I wish he war let blood for 't, that's all," said John, grimly.
 
 Adam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was, and had been
 relieved from all anxiety about the effects of his blow by learning
 that he was gone out for a ride. At five o'clock he was punctually there
 again, and sent up word of his arrival. In a few minutes Pym came down
--**--**--
 THE next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church,
 hoping for an invitation to go home with them. He had the letter in
 his pocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty
 alone. He could not see her face at church, for she had changed her
 seat, and when he came up to her to shake hands, her manner was doubtful
 and constrained. He expected this, for it was the first time she had
 met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with Arthur in the
 Grove.
 
 "Come, you'll go on with us, Adam," Mr. Poyser said when they reached
 the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to
 offer his arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of
 lingering behind a little, and then Adam said:
 
 "Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this
 evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I've something partic'lar to talk to
 you about."
 
 Hetty said, "Very well." She was really as anxious as Adam was that she
 should have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of
 her and Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had
 no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam.
 Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with her, and
 perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle, but it never entered her mind
 that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It was a
 relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted to
 speak to her alone, for she had trembled when she found he was going
--**--**--
 that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her, it was
 there the same as ever. How busy his thoughts were, as he walked home,
 in devising pitying excuses for her folly, in referring all her weakness
 to the sweet lovingness of her nature, in blaming Arthur, with less and
 less inclination to admit that his conduct might be extenuated too! His
 exasperation at Hetty's suffering--and also at the sense that she was
 possibly thrust for ever out of his own reach--deafened him to any
 plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery. Adam was a
 clear-sighted, fair-minded man--a fine fellow, indeed, morally as well
 as physically. But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and jealous,
 he was at that moment not perfectly magnanimous. And I cannot pretend
 that Adam, in these painful days, felt nothing but righteous indignation
 and loving pity. He was bitterly jealous, and in proportion as his love
 made him indulgent in his judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent
 in his feeling towards Arthur.
 
 "Her head was allays likely to be turned," he thought, "when a
 gentleman, with his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white hands,
 and that way o' talking gentlefolks have, came about her, making up to
 her in a bold way, as a man couldn't do that was only her equal; and
 it's much if she'll ever like a common man now." He could not help
 drawing his own hands out of his pocket and looking at them--at the hard
 palms and the broken finger-nails. "I'm a roughish fellow, altogether; I
 don't know, now I come to think on't, what there is much for a woman to
 like about me; and yet I might ha' got another wife easy enough, if
