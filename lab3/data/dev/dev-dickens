 "And so have I," exclaimed another. So had all.
 
 "But he was very light to carry," she resumed, intent upon her work,
 "and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And
 there is your father at the door!"
 
 She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had
 need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,
 and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young
 Cratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek
 against his face, as if they said, "Don't mind it, father. Don't be
 grieved!"
 
 Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.
 He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed
 of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,
 he said.
 
 "Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?" said his wife.
 
 "Yes, my dear," returned Bob. "I wish you could have gone. It would have
 done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I
 promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little
 child!" cried Bob. "My little child!"
 
 He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped
 it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they
 were.
 
 He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was
 lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close
 beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there
 lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and, when he had thought a little and
 composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what
--**--**--
 "And I know," said Bob, "I know, my dears, that when we recollect how
 patient and how mild he was, although he was a little, little child, we
 shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in
 doing it."
 
 "No, never, father!" they all cried again.
 
 "I am very happy," said little Bob, "I am very happy!"
 
 Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young
 Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny
 Tim, thy childish essence was from God!
 
 "Spectre," said Scrooge, "something informs me that our parting moment
 is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was
 whom we saw lying dead?"
 
 The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a
 different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these
 latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of
 business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not
 stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,
 until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.
 
 "This court," said Scrooge, "through which we hurry now, is where my
 place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the
 house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come."
 
 The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.
 
 "The house is yonder," Scrooge exclaimed. "Why do you point away?"
 
 The inexorable finger underwent no change.
 
 Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an
 office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the
 figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.
 
 He joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,
--**--**--
 
 The finger still was there.
 
 "Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me! I am not the
 man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this
 intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?"
 
 For the first time the hand appeared to shake.
 
 "Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it:
 "your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may
 change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?"
 
 The kind hand trembled.
 
 "I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I
 will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all
 Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they
 teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!"
 
 In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but
 he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger
 yet, repulsed him.
 
 Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw
 an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and
 dwindled down into a bedpost.
 
 
 
 
 STAVE FIVE
 
 THE END OF IT
 
 
 Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his
 own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make
 amends in!
 
 "I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!" Scrooge repeated
 as he scrambled out of bed. "The Spirits of all Three shall strive
 within me. Oh, Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised
 for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!"
--**--**--
 
 Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was
 a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long
 line of brilliant laughs!
 
 "I don't know what day of the month it is," said Scrooge. "I don't know
 how long I have been among the Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite
 a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!
 Hallo here!"
 
 He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the
 lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,
 bell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!
 
 Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no
 mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood
 to dance to; Golden sun-light; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry
 bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!
 
 "What's to-day?" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday
 clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
 
 "EH?" returned the boy with all his might of wonder.
 
 "What's to-day, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge.
 
 "To-day!" replied the boy. "Why, CHRISTMAS DAY."
 
 "It's Christmas Day!" said Scrooge to himself. "I haven't missed it. The
 Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.
 Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!"
 
 "Hallo!" returned the boy.
 
 "Do you know the Poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?"
 Scrooge inquired.
 
 "I should hope I did," replied the lad.
 
 "An intelligent boy!" said Scrooge. "A remarkable boy! Do you know
 whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?--Not
 the little prize Turkey: the big one?"
 
 "What! the one as big as me?" returned the boy.
--**--**--
 
 "I shall love it as long as I live!" cried Scrooge, patting it with his
 hand. "I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it
 has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey. Hallo!
 Whoop! How are you? Merry Christmas!"
 
 It _was_ a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.
 He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of
 sealing-wax.
 
 "Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town," said Scrooge. "You
 must have a cab."
 
 The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid
 for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the
 chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by
 the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and
 chuckled till he cried.
 
 Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;
 and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are
 at it. But, if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a
 piece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.
 
 He dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out into the
 streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them
 with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind
 him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so
 irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured
 fellows said, "Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!" And Scrooge
 said often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,
 those were the blithest in his ears.
 
 He had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly
--**--**--
 "Don't say anything, please," retorted Scrooge. "Come and see me. Will
 you come and see me?"
 
 "I will!" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.
 
 "Thankee," said Scrooge. "I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty
 times. Bless you!"
 
 He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people
 hurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned
 beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the
 windows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had
 never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much
 happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's
 house.
 
 He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and
 knock. But he made a dash, and did it.
 
 "Is your master at home, my dear?" said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl!
 Very.
 
 "Yes sir."
 
 "Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.
 
 "He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you
 up-stairs, if you please."
 
 "Thankee. He knows me," said Scrooge, with his hand already on the
 dining-room lock. "I'll go in here, my dear."
 
 He turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were
 looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these
 young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see
 that everything is right.
 
 "Fred!" said Scrooge.
 
 Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had
 forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the
 footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.
 
 "Why, bless my soul!" cried Fred, "who's that?"
 
 "It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,
--**--**--
 
 "A merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge with an earnestness that could
 not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. "A merrier Christmas,
 Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise
 your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will
 discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of
 smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle
 before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"
 
         *     *     *     *     *
 
 Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;
 and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as
 good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old City
 knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old
 world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them
 laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that
 nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did
 not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and, knowing that such as
 these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they
 should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less
 attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for
 him.
 
 He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the
 Total-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of
 him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed
 the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as
 Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!
