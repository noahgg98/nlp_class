 "Our ole raf'."
 
 "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?"
 
 "No, she warn't.  She was tore up a good deal--one en' of her was; but
 dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'.  Ef we
 hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn' ben so
 dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin' is,
 we'd a seed de raf'.  But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now she's
 all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in
 de place o' what 'uz los'."
 
 "Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?"
 
 "How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggers
 foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a
 crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um
 she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en
 settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but to
 you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's
 propaty, en git a hid'n for it?  Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey
 'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make
 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I
 wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey.  Dat Jack's a
 good nigger, en pooty smart."
 
 "Yes, he is.  He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and

 of the tree.  I ain't a-going to tell ALL that happened--it would make me
 sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn't ever come ashore that
 night to see such things.  I ain't ever going to get shut of them--lots
 of times I dream about them.
 
 I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
 Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
 gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
 trouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
 mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was
 to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
 Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I
 judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
 she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
 wouldn't ever happened.
 
 When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
 piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
 tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and
 got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering up
 Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.
 
 It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through
 the woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn't on his island, so I tramped
 off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to
 jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was gone!  My

 Jim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn't no home like a
 raft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
 raft don't.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XIX.
 
 TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
 they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put
 in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
 and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as
 night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in
 the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
 willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next we
 slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off;
 then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep,
 and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly still
 --just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs
 a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the water,
 was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you couldn't
 make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness
 spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn't black
 any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever
 so far away--trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks
 --rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices,
 it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a
--**--**--
 
 "Gentlemen," says the young man, very solemn, "I will reveal it to you,
 for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I am a duke!"
 
 Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.
 Then the baldhead says:  "No! you can't mean it?"
 
 "Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled
 to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
 air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
 dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the
 titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal
 descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and
 here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by
 the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
 companionship of felons on a raft!"
 
 Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but
 he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we was
 a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything
 else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we ought to
 bow when we spoke to him, and say "Your Grace," or "My Lord," or "Your
 Lordship"--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain
 "Bridgewater," which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and
 one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him
 he wanted done.
 
 Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood
 around and waited on him, and says, "Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or
--**--**--
 up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running
 --was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:
 
 "Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run SOUTH?"
 
 No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so I
 says:
 
 "My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
 they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed he'd
 break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little
 one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was
 pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't
 nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't enough
 to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.  Well,
 when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this
 piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.  Pa's luck
 didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one
 night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me
 come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so
 they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or two we had
 considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and
 trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway
 nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother us."
 
 The duke says:
 
 "Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
 want to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.
--**--**--
 had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones
 had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the
 children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt.  Some of
 the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on
 the sly.
 
 The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined
 out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
 there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he
 lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up more
 and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to
 groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to preach, and
 begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform
 and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with
 his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with
 all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and
 spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting,
 "It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon it and live!"  And
 people would shout out, "Glory!--A-a-MEN!"  And so he went on, and the
 people groaning and crying and saying amen:
 
 "Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (AMEN!) come,
 sick and sore! (AMEN!) come, lame and halt and blind! (AMEN!) come, pore
 and needy, sunk in shame! (A-A-MEN!) come, all that's worn and soiled and
 suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come
 in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door
--**--**--
   In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn
   In customary suits of solemn black,
   But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
   Breathes forth contagion on the world,
   And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage,
   Is sicklied o'er with care,
   And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops,
   With this regard their currents turn awry,
   And lose the name of action.
   'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
   But soft you, the fair Ophelia:
   Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws,
   But get thee to a nunnery--go!
 
 Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
 could do it first-rate.  It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
 he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
 would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.
 
 The first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed; and after
 that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most
 uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword fighting and
 rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time.  One morning,
 when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a
 little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters
 of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a
 tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and
 went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our
 show.
 
 We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
--**--**--
 Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know I
 warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year."
 
 Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
 Injun, and singing out:
 
 "Cler the track, thar.  I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is
 a-gwyne to raise."
 
 He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year
 old, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
 and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and lay
 them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because he'd
 come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat
 first, and spoon vittles to top off on."
 
 He see me, and rode up and says:
 
 "Whar'd you come f'm, boy?  You prepared to die?"
 
 Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:
 
 "He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's
 drunk.  He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,
 drunk nor sober."
 
 Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so
 he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
 
 "Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.
 You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!"
 
 And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
 to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
 going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a
 heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and
 the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,
--**--**--
 shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him air, give him air!"
 
 Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around
 on his heels and walked off.
 
 They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
 the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place
 at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They laid him
 on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another
 one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and
 I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a dozen long
 gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and
 letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that he laid
 still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from him,
 screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and very
 sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
 
 Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
 pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that
 had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying
 all the time, "Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right
 and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody
 a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you."
 
 There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there
 was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was
 excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,
 and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,
--**--**--
 Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The
 stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow
 along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
 out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.
 Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the
 kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand
 in it.
 
 Then he says, slow and scornful:
 
 "The idea of YOU lynching anybody!  It's amusing.  The idea of you
 thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN!  Because you're brave
 enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
 here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
 MAN?  Why, a MAN'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as
 long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.
 
 "Do I know you?  I know you clear through was born and raised in the
 South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
 The average man's a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
 that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
 In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in
 the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a brave people
 so much that you think you are braver than any other people--whereas
 you're just AS brave, and no braver.  Why don't your juries hang
 murderers?  Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in
 the back, in the dark--and it's just what they WOULD do.
 
 "So they always acquit; and then a MAN goes in the night, with a hundred
--**--**--
 
 WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a
 curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was
 jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn't hold no more, the
 duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the
 stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and
 praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that
 ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
 Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
 and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he
 rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out
 on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-
 striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.  And--but never
 mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny.
 The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done
 capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and
 stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after
 that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to
 see the shines that old idiot cut.
 
 Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
 the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
 pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it
 in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
 succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
--**--**--
 Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
 three nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
 before.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:
 
 "Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"
 
 "No," I says, "it don't."
 
 "Why don't it, Huck?"
 
 "Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.  I reckon they're all alike,"
 
 "But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what
 dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions."
 
 "Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur
 as I can make out."
 
 "Is dat so?"
 
 "You read about them once--you'll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n
 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to HIM.  And look at Charles Second,
 and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
 Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
 heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,
 you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He WAS a
 blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
 next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
 ordering up eggs.  'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch her up.
 Next morning, 'Chop off her head!'  And they chop it off.  'Fetch up Jane
 Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'--and
 they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.'  Fair Rosamun answers the
 bell.  Next morning, 'Chop off her head.'  And he made every one of them
 tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a
 thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and
--**--**--
 done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
 his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I
 didn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was
 thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
 and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his
 life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
 folks does for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.  He
 was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was
 asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty
 hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!"  He was a
 mighty good nigger, Jim was.
 
 But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
 ones; and by and by he says:
 
 "What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder
 on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I
 treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery.  She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole,
 en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got
 well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I says:
 
 "'Shet de do'.'
 
 "She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.  It make me
 mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:
 
 "'Doan' you hear me?  Shet de do'!'
 
 "She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up.  I was a-bilin'!  I says:
 
 "'I lay I MAKE you mine!'
 
 "En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.
--**--**--
 Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
 that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and
 everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
 Peter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a
 carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so
 on, and so on.  Then he says:
 
 "What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"
 
 "Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop
 there.  When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat
 will, but this is a St. Louis one."
 
 "Was Peter Wilks well off?"
 
 "Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he
 left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."
 
 "When did you say he died?"
 
 "I didn't say, but it was last night."
 
 "Funeral to-morrow, likely?"
 
 "Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."
 
 "Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or
 another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right."
 
 "Yes, sir, it's the best way.  Ma used to always say that."
 
 When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
 got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my
 ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
 another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
 
 "Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
 carpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and
 git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now."
--**--**--
 and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious.  But
 when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't
 want to--"
 
 "Hold on," says the duke.  "Le's make up the deffisit," and he begun to
 haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
 
 "It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you HAVE got a rattlin' clever head
 on you," says the king.  "Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us
 out agin," and HE begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.
 
 It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
 
 "Say," says the duke, "I got another idea.  Le's go up stairs and count
 this money, and then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS."
 
 "Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a
 man struck.  You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.
 Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it.  Let 'em
 fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out."
 
 When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king
 he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty
 elegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their
 chops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
 to swell himself up for another speech.  He says:
 
 "Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
 that's left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by these
 yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left
 fatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
 would a done MORE generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his
--**--**--
 
 "All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him; "we'll try and
 get 'em to send for you;" which made them all laugh, and they said it was
 a prime good hit.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXVI.
 
 WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
 for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
 Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a
 little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
 sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
 The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.
 
 So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain
 but nice.  She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took
 out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said they
 warn't.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a
 curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an old
 hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts of
 little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
 with.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
 these fixings, and so don't disturb them.  The duke's room was pretty
 small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
 
 That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
 and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and
 the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of the
 table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was,
--**--**--
 believe the rest."
 
 "What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says Mary Jane, stepping in with
 Susan behind her.  "It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him,
 and him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be
 treated so?"
 
 "That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before
 they're hurt.  I hain't done nothing to him.  He's told some stretchers,
 I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit and
 grain I DID say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't
 he?"
 
 "I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our
 house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it.  If you was in
 his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a
 thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed."
 
 "Why, Maim, he said--"
 
 "It don't make no difference what he SAID--that ain't the thing.  The
 thing is for you to treat him KIND, and not be saying things to make him
 remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks."
 
 I says to myself, THIS is a girl that I'm letting that old reptle rob her
 of her money!
 
 Then Susan SHE waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give
 Hare-lip hark from the tomb!
 
 Says I to myself, and this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob her of
 her money!
 
 Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
 again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly
 anything left o' poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.
 
 "All right, then," says the other girls; "you just ask his pardon."
--**--**--
 set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
 set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
 hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin lid
 was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with
 folks around.
 
 Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
 in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
 people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead
 man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very
 still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
 their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little.  There
 warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
 blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a funeral than
 they do at other places except church.
 
 When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
 gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and
 getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no
 more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people around, he
 squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,
 and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over against the wall.
 He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there
 warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.
 
 They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready a
 young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
--**--**--
 says:
 
 "Quick sales AND small profits!  It's a good business--yes."
 
 The king snarls around on him and says:
 
 "I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.  If the
 profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry,
 is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?"
 
 "Well, THEY'D be in this house yet and we WOULDN'T if I could a got my
 advice listened to."
 
 The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around
 and lit into ME again.  He give me down the banks for not coming and
 TELLING him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way--said
 any fool would a KNOWED something was up.  And then waltzed in and cussed
 HIMSELF awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking
 his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it
 again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd worked it
 all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXVIII.
 
 BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started
 for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and
 I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd
 been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she had
 stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands,
 crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I went in
 there and says:
 
 "Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't
 --most always.  Tell me about it."
--**--**--
 think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular.
 I never see nothing like it.  Well, I says to myself at last, I'm a-going
 to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem
 most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
 where you'll go to. Then I says:
 
 "Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
 could go and stay three or four days?"
 
 "Yes; Mr. Lothrop's.  Why?"
 
 "Never mind why yet.  If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see
 each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and PROVE how I
 know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"
 
 "Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"
 
 "All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of YOU than just your
 word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible."  She smiled
 and reddened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll shut
 the door--and bolt it."
 
 Then I come back and set down again, and says:
 
 "Don't you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to tell
 the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind,
 and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.  These
 uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of frauds
 --regular dead-beats.  There, now we're over the worst of it, you can stand
 the rest middling easy."
 
 It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
 water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
 all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck
--**--**--
 opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it ain't
 no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays
 over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go
 out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've
 thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she
 would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me
 to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.
 
 Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see
 her go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
 
 "What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that
 you all goes to see sometimes?"
 
 They says:
 
 "There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."
 
 "That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she
 told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of
 them's sick."
 
 "Which one?"
 
 "I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--"
 
 "Sakes alive, I hope it ain't HANNER?"
 
 "I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's the very one."
 
 "My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?"
 
 "It ain't no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane
 said, and they don't think she'll last many hours."
 
 "Only think of that, now!  What's the matter with her?"
 
 I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
 
 "Mumps."
 
 "Mumps your granny!  They don't set up with people that's got the mumps."
 
 "They don't, don't they?  You better bet they do with THESE mumps.  These
--**--**--
 If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't
 you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole
 harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow,
 as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to
 get it hitched on good."
 
 "Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip.  "I'll go to Uncle Harvey
 and--"
 
 "Oh, yes," I says, "I WOULD.  Of COURSE I would.  I wouldn't lose no
 time."
 
 "Well, why wouldn't you?"
 
 "Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain't your uncles
 obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you
 reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
 journey by yourselves?  YOU know they'll wait for you.  So fur, so good.
 Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he?  Very well, then; is a PREACHER
 going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK?
 --so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now YOU know he
 ain't.  What WILL he do, then?  Why, he'll say, 'It's a great pity, but
 my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my
 niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's
 my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to
 show on her if she's got it.'  But never mind, if you think it's best to
 tell your uncle Harvey--"
 
 "Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
 times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's
 got it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins."
--**--**--
 
 
 CHAPTER XXIX.
 
 
 THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
 nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,
 how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn't see no
 joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to
 see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did THEY
 turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went
 a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out
 buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful
 on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to
 think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world.  Oh, he done
 it admirable.  Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to
 let him see they was on his side.  That old gentleman that had just come
 looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see
 straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman--not the king's way, though
 the king's WAS pretty good for an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's
 words, nor I can't imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and
 says, about like this:
 
 "This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
 acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and
 answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm,
 and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
 by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his brother
 William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to amount
--**--**--
 kept it up; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They made
 the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and
 anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old
 gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by they
 had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed look
 out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right
 side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all
 about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till
 the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:
 
 "Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon you
 ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
 practice.  You do it pretty awkward."
 
 I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
 anyway.
 
 The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
 
 "If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--" The king broke in and
 reached out his hand, and says:
 
 "Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
 about?"
 
 The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,
 and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked
 low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
 
 "That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your
 brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."
 
 So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
--**--**--
 eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king THIS time, and says:
 
 "There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter
 Wilks' breast?"
 
 Both of them spoke up and says:
 
 "We didn't see no such mark."
 
 "Good!" says the old gentleman.  "Now, what you DID see on his breast was
 a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
 young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W"--and he marked
 them that way on a piece of paper.  "Come, ain't that what you saw?"
 
 Both of them spoke up again, and says:
 
 "No, we DIDN'T.  We never seen any marks at all."
 
 Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
 
 "The whole BILIN' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's
 ride 'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a
 rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and
 says:
 
 "Gentlemen--gentleMEN!  Hear me just a word--just a SINGLE word--if you
 PLEASE!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look."
 
 That took them.
 
 "Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer
 and the doctor sung out:
 
 "Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch THEM
 along, too!"
 
 "We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don't find them marks we'll
 lynch the whole gang!"
 
 I WAS scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you
 know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
 graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town
 at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
--**--**--
 
 "Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we're shut
 of them!"
 
 Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
 full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in
 my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
 Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
 lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
 bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
 king and the duke, but I says:
 
 "Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and
 let her slide!"
 
 So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it DID seem
 so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
 nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack
 my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I
 noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and
 listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over
 the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and making
 their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.
 
 So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all
 I could do to keep from crying.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXX.
 
 WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,
 and says:
 
 "Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,
 hey?"
--**--**--
 
 "Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't know--maybe you was
 asleep, and didn't know what you was about."
 
 The duke bristles up now, and says:
 
 "Oh, let UP on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
 Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?"
 
 "YES, sir!  I know you DO know, because you done it yourself!"
 
 "It's a lie!"--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:
 
 "Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!"
 
 The duke says:
 
 "Well, you just own up, first, that you DID hide that money there,
 intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it
 up, and have it all to yourself."
 
 "Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;
 if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and take
 back everything I said."
 
 "You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't.  There, now!"
 
 "Well, then, I b'lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now
 DON'T git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
 it?"
 
 The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
 
 "Well, I don't care if I DID, I didn't DO it, anyway.  But you not only
 had it in mind to do it, but you DONE it."
 
 "I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest.  I won't say
 I warn't goin' to do it, because I WAS; but you--I mean somebody--got in
 ahead o' me."
 
 "It's a lie!  You done it, and you got to SAY you done it, or--"
 
 The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
 
 "'Nough!--I OWN UP!"
--**--**--
 before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all out of
 breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
 
 "Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"
 
 But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was
 gone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
 this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't no
 use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it.
 But I couldn't set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
 trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and
 asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:
 
 "Yes."
 
 "Whereabouts?" says I.
 
 "Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here.  He's a runaway
 nigger, and they've got him.  Was you looking for him?"
 
 "You bet I ain't!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
 ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay
 down and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard
 to come out."
 
 "Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.
 He run off f'm down South, som'ers."
 
 "It's a good job they got him."
 
 "Well, I RECKON!  There's two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It's like
 picking up money out'n the road."
 
 "Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him
 FIRST. Who nailed him?"
 
 "It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for
 forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.  Think
--**--**--
 felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it
 straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
 how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
 and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our
 trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
 and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
 a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
 couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
 other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
 calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I
 come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up
 there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me
 honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
 good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
 the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
 the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got
 now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
 
 It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was
 a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
 I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
 says to myself:
 
 "All right, then, I'll GO to hell"--and tore it up.
 
 It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let them
