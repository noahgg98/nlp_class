 MRS. HIGGINS. Well, I'm very glad you're not going to do anything
 foolish, Mr. Doolittle. For this solves the problem of Eliza's future.
 You can provide for her now.
 
 DOOLITTLE [with melancholy resignation] Yes, ma'am; I'm expected to
 provide for everyone now, out of three thousand a year.
 
 HIGGINS [jumping up] Nonsense! he can't provide for her. He shan't
 provide for her. She doesn't belong to him. I paid him five pounds for
 her. Doolittle: either you're an honest man or a rogue.
 
 DOOLITTLE [tolerantly] A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us: a
 little of both.
 
 HIGGINS. Well, you took that money for the girl; and you have no right
 to take her as well.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Henry: don't be absurd. If you really want to know where
 Eliza is, she is upstairs.
 
 HIGGINS [amazed] Upstairs!!! Then I shall jolly soon fetch her
 downstairs. [He makes resolutely for the door].
 
 MRS. HIGGINS [rising and following him] Be quiet, Henry. Sit down.
 
 HIGGINS. I--
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Sit down, dear; and listen to me.
 
 HIGGINS. Oh very well, very well, very well. [He throws himself
 ungraciously on the ottoman, with his face towards the windows]. But I
 think you might have told me this half an hour ago.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Eliza came to me this morning. She passed the night
 partly walking about in a rage, partly trying to throw herself into the
 river and being afraid to, and partly in the Carlton Hotel. She told me
 of the brutal way you two treated her.
 
 HIGGINS [bounding up again] What!
 
 PICKERING [rising also] My dear Mrs. Higgins, she's been telling you
 stories. We didn't treat her brutally. We hardly said a word to her;
 and we parted on particularly good terms. [Turning on Higgins]. Higgins
 did you bully her after I went to bed?
--**--**--
 as to step out on the balcony for a moment. I don't want Eliza to have
 the shock of your news until she has made it up with these two
 gentlemen. Would you mind?
 
 DOOLITTLE. As you wish, lady. Anything to help Henry to keep her off my
 hands. [He disappears through the window].
 
 The parlor-maid answers the bell. Pickering sits down in Doolittle's
 place.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Ask Miss Doolittle to come down, please.
 
 THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam. [She goes out].
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Now, Henry: be good.
 
 HIGGINS. I am behaving myself perfectly.
 
 PICKERING. He is doing his best, Mrs. Higgins.
 
 A pause. Higgins throws back his head; stretches out his legs; and
 begins to whistle.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Henry, dearest, you don't look at all nice in that
 attitude.
 
 HIGGINS [pulling himself together] I was not trying to look nice,
 mother.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. It doesn't matter, dear. I only wanted to make you speak.
 
 HIGGINS. Why?
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Because you can't speak and whistle at the same time.
 
 Higgins groans. Another very trying pause.
 
 HIGGINS [springing up, out of patience] Where the devil is that girl?
 Are we to wait here all day?
 
 Eliza enters, sunny, self-possessed, and giving a staggeringly
 convincing exhibition of ease of manner. She carries a little
 work-basket, and is very much at home. Pickering is too much taken
 aback to rise.
 
 LIZA. How do you do, Professor Higgins? Are you quite well?
 
 HIGGINS [choking] Am I-- [He can say no more].
 
 LIZA. But of course you are: you are never ill. So glad to see you
 again, Colonel Pickering. [He rises hastily; and they shake hands].
 Quite chilly this morning, isn't it? [She sits down on his left. He
 sits beside her].
 
 HIGGINS. Don't you dare try this game on me. I taught it to you; and it
--**--**--
 PICKERING. What?
 
 LIZA [stopping her work for a moment] Your calling me Miss Doolittle
 that day when I first came to Wimpole Street. That was the beginning of
 self-respect for me. [She resumes her stitching]. And there were a
 hundred little things you never noticed, because they came naturally to
 you. Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening
 doors--
 
 PICKERING. Oh, that was nothing.
 
 LIZA. Yes: things that showed you thought and felt about me as if I
 were something better than a scullerymaid; though of course I know you
 would have been just the same to a scullery-maid if she had been let in
 the drawing-room. You never took off your boots in the dining room when
 I was there.
 
 PICKERING. You mustn't mind that. Higgins takes off his boots all over
 the place.
 
 LIZA. I know. I am not blaming him. It is his way, isn't it? But it
 made such a difference to me that you didn't do it. You see, really and
 truly, apart from the things anyone can pick up (the dressing and the
 proper way of speaking, and so on), the difference between a lady and a
 flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she's treated. I shall
 always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because he always treats
 me as a flower girl, and always will; but I know I can be a lady to
 you, because you always treat me as a lady, and always will.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. Please don't grind your teeth, Henry.
 
 PICKERING. Well, this is really very nice of you, Miss Doolittle.
 
 LIZA. I should like you to call me Eliza, now, if you would.
 
 PICKERING. Thank you. Eliza, of course.
 
 LIZA. And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss Doolittle.
--**--**--
 
 DOOLITTLE. Don't be afraid: she never comes to words with anyone now,
 poor woman! respectability has broke all the spirit out of her.
 
 PICKERING [squeezing Eliza's elbow gently] Be kind to them, Eliza. Make
 the best of it.
 
 LIZA [forcing a little smile for him through her vexation] Oh well,
 just to show there's no ill feeling. I'll be back in a moment. [She
 goes out].
 
 DOOLITTLE [sitting down beside Pickering] I feel uncommon nervous about
 the ceremony, Colonel. I wish you'd come and see me through it.
 
 PICKERING. But you've been through it before, man. You were married to
 Eliza's mother.
 
 DOOLITTLE. Who told you that, Colonel?
 
 PICKERING. Well, nobody told me. But I concluded naturally--
 
 DOOLITTLE. No: that ain't the natural way, Colonel: it's only the
 middle class way. My way was always the undeserving way. But don't say
 nothing to Eliza. She don't know: I always had a delicacy about telling
 her.
 
 PICKERING. Quite right. We'll leave it so, if you don't mind.
 
 DOOLITTLE. And you'll come to the church, Colonel, and put me through
 straight?
 
 PICKERING. With pleasure. As far as a bachelor can.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS. May I come, Mr. Doolittle? I should be very sorry to miss
 your wedding.
 
 DOOLITTLE. I should indeed be honored by your condescension, ma'am; and
 my poor old woman would take it as a tremenjous compliment. She's been
 very low, thinking of the happy days that are no more.
 
 MRS. HIGGINS [rising] I'll order the carriage and get ready. [The men
 rise, except Higgins]. I shan't be more than fifteen minutes. [As she
 goes to the door Eliza comes in, hatted and buttoning her gloves]. I'm
 going to the church to see your father married, Eliza. You had better
 come in the brougham with me. Colonel Pickering can go on with the
--**--**--
 HIGGINS. About you, not about me. If you come back I shall treat you
 just as I have always treated you. I can't change my nature; and I
 don't intend to change my manners. My manners are exactly the same as
 Colonel Pickering's.
 
 LIZA. That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she was a duchess.
 
 HIGGINS. And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.
 
 LIZA. I see. [She turns away composedly, and sits on the ottoman,
 facing the window]. The same to everybody.
 
 HIGGINS. Just so.
 
 LIZA. Like father.
 
 HIGGINS [grinning, a little taken down] Without accepting the
 comparison at all points, Eliza, it's quite true that your father is
 not a snob, and that he will be quite at home in any station of life to
 which his eccentric destiny may call him. [Seriously] The great secret,
 Eliza, is not having bad manners or good manners or any other
 particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human
 souls: in short, behaving as if you were in Heaven, where there are no
 third-class carriages, and one soul is as good as another.
 
 LIZA. Amen. You are a born preacher.
 
 HIGGINS [irritated] The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but
 whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.
 
 LIZA [with sudden sincerity] I don't care how you treat me. I don't
 mind your swearing at me. I don't mind a black eye: I've had one before
 this. But [standing up and facing him] I won't be passed over.
 
 HIGGINS. Then get out of my way; for I won't stop for you. You talk
 about me as if I were a motor bus.
 
 LIZA. So you are a motor bus: all bounce and go, and no consideration
--**--**--
 
 HIGGINS [heartily] Why, because it was my job.
 
 LIZA. You never thought of the trouble it would make for me.
 
 HIGGINS. Would the world ever have been made if its maker had been
 afraid of making trouble? Making life means making trouble. There's
 only one way of escaping trouble; and that's killing things. Cowards,
 you notice, are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed.
 
 LIZA. I'm no preacher: I don't notice things like that. I notice that
 you don't notice me.
 
 HIGGINS [jumping up and walking about intolerantly] Eliza: you're an
 idiot. I waste the treasures of my Miltonic mind by spreading them
 before you. Once for all, understand that I go my way and do my work
 without caring twopence what happens to either of us. I am not
 intimidated, like your father and your stepmother. So you can come back
 or go to the devil: which you please.
 
 LIZA. What am I to come back for?
 
 HIGGINS [bouncing up on his knees on the ottoman and leaning over it to
 her] For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.
 
 LIZA [with averted face] And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don't
 do everything you want me to?
 
 HIGGINS. Yes; and you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything
 YOU want me to.
 
 LIZA. And live with my stepmother?
 
 HIGGINS. Yes, or sell flowers.
 
 LIZA. Oh! if I only COULD go back to my flower basket! I should be
 independent of both you and father and all the world! Why did you take
 my independence from me? Why did I give it up? I'm a slave now, for all
 my fine clothes.
 
 HIGGINS. Not a bit. I'll adopt you as my daughter and settle money on
 you if you like. Or would you rather marry Pickering?
--**--**--
 LIZA [much troubled] I want a little kindness. I know I'm a common
 ignorant girl, and you a book-learned gentleman; but I'm not dirt under
 your feet. What I done [correcting herself] what I did was not for the
 dresses and the taxis: I did it because we were pleasant together and I
 come--came--to care for you; not to want you to make love to me, and
 not forgetting the difference between us, but more friendly like.
 
 HIGGINS. Well, of course. That's just how I feel. And how Pickering
 feels. Eliza: you're a fool.
 
 LIZA. That's not a proper answer to give me [she sinks on the chair at
 the writing-table in tears].
 
 HIGGINS. It's all you'll get until you stop being a common idiot. If
 you're going to be a lady, you'll have to give up feeling neglected if
 the men you know don't spend half their time snivelling over you and
 the other half giving you black eyes. If you can't stand the coldness
 of my sort of life, and the strain of it, go back to the gutter. Work
 til you are more a brute than a human being; and then cuddle and
 squabble and drink til you fall asleep. Oh, it's a fine life, the life
 of the gutter. It's real: it's warm: it's violent: you can feel it
 through the thickest skin: you can taste it and smell it without any
 training or any work. Not like Science and Literature and Classical
 Music and Philosophy and Art. You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
 don't you? Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like.
 Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick
 pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you
--**--**--
 strike me some day. [He lets her go, stamping with rage at having
 forgotten himself, and recoils so hastily that he stumbles back into
 his seat on the ottoman]. Aha! Now I know how to deal with you. What a
 fool I was not to think of it before! You can't take away the knowledge
 you gave me. You said I had a finer ear than you. And I can be civil
 and kind to people, which is more than you can. Aha! That's done you,
 Henry Higgins, it has. Now I don't care that [snapping her fingers] for
 your bullying and your big talk. I'll advertize it in the papers that
 your duchess is only a flower girl that you taught, and that she'll
 teach anybody to be a duchess just the same in six months for a
 thousand guineas. Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet
 and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to
 lift up my finger to be as good as you, I could just kick myself.
 
 HIGGINS [wondering at her] You damned impudent slut, you! But it's
 better than snivelling; better than fetching slippers and finding
 spectacles, isn't it? [Rising] By George, Eliza, I said I'd make a
 woman of you; and I have. I like you like this.
 
 LIZA. Yes: you turn round and make up to me now that I'm not afraid of
 you, and can do without you.
 
 HIGGINS. Of course I do, you little fool. Five minutes ago you were
 like a millstone round my neck. Now you're a tower of strength: a
 consort battleship. You and I and Pickering will be three old bachelors
 together instead of only two men and a silly girl.
 
 Mrs. Higgins returns, dressed for the wedding. Eliza instantly becomes

 began by selling oranges. Nevertheless, people in all directions have
 assumed, for no other reason than that she became the heroine of a
 romance, that she must have married the hero of it. This is unbearable,
 not only because her little drama, if acted on such a thoughtless
 assumption, must be spoiled, but because the true sequel is patent to
 anyone with a sense of human nature in general, and of feminine
 instinct in particular.
 
 Eliza, in telling Higgins she would not marry him if he asked her, was
 not coquetting: she was announcing a well-considered decision. When a
 bachelor interests, and dominates, and teaches, and becomes important
 to a spinster, as Higgins with Eliza, she always, if she has character
 enough to be capable of it, considers very seriously indeed whether she
 will play for becoming that bachelor's wife, especially if he is so
 little interested in marriage that a determined and devoted woman might
 capture him if she set herself resolutely to do it. Her decision will
 depend a good deal on whether she is really free to choose; and that,
 again, will depend on her age and income. If she is at the end of her
 youth, and has no security for her livelihood, she will marry him
 because she must marry anybody who will provide for her. But at Eliza's
 age a good-looking girl does not feel that pressure; she feels free to
 pick and choose. She is therefore guided by her instinct in the matter.
 Eliza's instinct tells her not to marry Higgins. It does not tell her
 to give him up. It is not in the slightest doubt as to his remaining
 one of the strongest personal interests in her life. It would be very
 sorely strained if there was another woman likely to supplant her with
--**--**--
 Put that along with her resentment of Higgins's domineering
 superiority, and her mistrust of his coaxing cleverness in getting
 round her and evading her wrath when he had gone too far with his
 impetuous bullying, and you will see that Eliza's instinct had good
 grounds for warning her not to marry her Pygmalion.
 
 And now, whom did Eliza marry? For if Higgins was a predestinate old
 bachelor, she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid. Well,
 that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the
 indications she has herself given them.
 
 Almost immediately after Eliza is stung into proclaiming her considered
 determination not to marry Higgins, she mentions the fact that young
 Mr. Frederick Eynsford Hill is pouring out his love for her daily
 through the post. Now Freddy is young, practically twenty years younger
 than Higgins: he is a gentleman (or, as Eliza would qualify him, a
 toff), and speaks like one; he is nicely dressed, is treated by the
 Colonel as an equal, loves her unaffectedly, and is not her master, nor
 ever likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social
 standing. Eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all
 women love to be mastered, if not actually bullied and beaten. "When
 you go to women," says Nietzsche, "take your whip with you." Sensible
 despots have never confined that precaution to women: they have taken
 their whips with them when they have dealt with men, and been slavishly
 idealized by the men over whom they have flourished the whip much more
 than by women. No doubt there are slavish women as well as slavish men;
 and women, like men, admire those that are stronger than themselves.
 But to admire a strong person and to live under that strong person's
--**--**--
 degree that overwhelms all her other instincts, she will, if she
 marries either of them, marry Freddy.
 
 And that is just what Eliza did.
 
 Complications ensued; but they were economic, not romantic. Freddy had
 no money and no occupation. His mother's jointure, a last relic of the
 opulence of Largelady Park, had enabled her to struggle along in
 Earlscourt with an air of gentility, but not to procure any serious
 secondary education for her children, much less give the boy a
 profession. A clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath Freddy's
 dignity, and extremely distasteful to him besides. His prospects
 consisted of a hope that if he kept up appearances somebody would do
 something for him. The something appeared vaguely to his imagination as
 a private secretaryship or a sinecure of some sort. To his mother it
 perhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady of means who could not
 resist her boy's niceness. Fancy her feelings when he married a flower
 girl who had become declassee under extraordinary circumstances which
 were now notorious!
 
 It is true that Eliza's situation did not seem wholly ineligible. Her
 father, though formerly a dustman, and now fantastically disclassed,
 had become extremely popular in the smartest society by a social talent
 which triumphed over every prejudice and every disadvantage. Rejected
 by the middle class, which he loathed, he had shot up at once into the
 highest circles by his wit, his dustmanship (which he carried like a
 banner), and his Nietzschean transcendence of good and evil. At
 intimate ducal dinners he sat on the right hand of the Duchess; and in
 country houses he smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the
 butler when he was not feeding in the dining-room and being consulted
 by cabinet ministers. But he found it almost as hard to do all this on
--**--**--
 
 This difficulty was removed by an event highly unexpected by Freddy's
 mother. Clara, in the course of her incursions into those artistic
 circles which were the highest within her reach, discovered that her
 conversational qualifications were expected to include a grounding in
 the novels of Mr. H.G. Wells. She borrowed them in various directions
 so energetically that she swallowed them all within two months. The
 result was a conversion of a kind quite common today. A modern Acts of
 the Apostles would fill fifty whole Bibles if anyone were capable of
 writing it.
 
 Poor Clara, who appeared to Higgins and his mother as a disagreeable
 and ridiculous person, and to her own mother as in some inexplicable
 way a social failure, had never seen herself in either light; for,
 though to some extent ridiculed and mimicked in West Kensington like
 everybody else there, she was accepted as a rational and normal--or
 shall we say inevitable?--sort of human being. At worst they called her
 The Pusher; but to them no more than to herself had it ever occurred
 that she was pushing the air, and pushing it in a wrong direction.
 Still, she was not happy. She was growing desperate. Her one asset, the
 fact that her mother was what the Epsom greengrocer called a carriage
 lady had no exchange value, apparently. It had prevented her from
 getting educated, because the only education she could have afforded
 was education with the Earlscourt green grocer's daughter. It had led
 her to seek the society of her mother's class; and that class simply
 would not have her, because she was much poorer than the greengrocer,
 and, far from being able to afford a maid, could not afford even a
 housemaid, and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated
 general servant. Under such circumstances nothing could give her an air
--**--**--
 exposed the vanity of Largelady Park and finished her. It exasperated
 her to think that the dungeon in which she had languished for so many
 unhappy years had been unlocked all the time, and that the impulses she
 had so carefully struggled with and stifled for the sake of keeping
 well with society, were precisely those by which alone she could have
 come into any sort of sincere human contact. In the radiance of these
 discoveries, and the tumult of their reaction, she made a fool of
 herself as freely and conspicuously as when she so rashly adopted
 Eliza's expletive in Mrs. Higgins's drawing-room; for the new-born
 Wellsian had to find her bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby; but
 nobody hates a baby for its ineptitudes, or thinks the worse of it for
 trying to eat the matches; and Clara lost no friends by her follies.
 They laughed at her to her face this time; and she had to defend
 herself and fight it out as best she could.
 
 When Freddy paid a visit to Earlscourt (which he never did when he
 could possibly help it) to make the desolating announcement that he and
 his Eliza were thinking of blackening the Largelady scutcheon by
 opening a shop, he found the little household already convulsed by a
 prior announcement from Clara that she also was going to work in an old
 furniture shop in Dover Street, which had been started by a fellow
 Wellsian. This appointment Clara owed, after all, to her old social
 accomplishment of Push. She had made up her mind that, cost what it
 might, she would see Mr. Wells in the flesh; and she had achieved her
 end at a garden party. She had better luck than so rash an enterprise
 deserved. Mr. Wells came up to her expectations. Age had not withered
--**--**--
 School with Kew Gardens. Eliza, to whom the procedure of the Dickensian
 gentleman seemed perfectly correct (as in fact it was) and not in the
 least funny (which was only her ignorance) took his advice with entire
 gravity. But the effort that cost her the deepest humiliation was a
 request to Higgins, whose pet artistic fancy, next to Milton's verse,
 was calligraphy, and who himself wrote a most beautiful Italian hand,
 that he would teach her to write. He declared that she was congenitally
 incapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of Milton's
 words; but she persisted; and again he suddenly threw himself into the
 task of teaching her with a combination of stormy intensity,
 concentrated patience, and occasional bursts of interesting
 disquisition on the beauty and nobility, the august mission and
 destiny, of human handwriting. Eliza ended by acquiring an extremely
 uncommercial script which was a positive extension of her personal
 beauty, and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else
 because certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to
 her. She could not even address an envelope in the usual way because it
 made the margins all wrong.
 
 Their commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for
 the young couple. They seemed to be learning nothing about flower
 shops. At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the
 shorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of
 Economics from their feet for ever. Besides, the business was in some
 mysterious way beginning to take care of itself. They had somehow
 forgotten their objections to employing other people. They came to the
 conclusion that their own way was the best, and that they had really a
 remarkable talent for business. The Colonel, who had been compelled for
