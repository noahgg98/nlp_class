 so struck with him as you?"
 
 "Doesn't regard him you mean as such an 'eligible' young man?  Is that
 what I've come to?" he audibly and rather gravely sought to know.
 "However," he went on, "his marriage is what his mother most
 desires--that is if it will help.  And oughtn't ANY marriage to help?
 They must want him"--he had already worked it out--"to be better off.
 Almost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking
 up his chances.  It won't suit HER at least that he shall miss them."
 
 Miss Gostrey cast about.  "No--you reason well! But of course on the
 other hand there's always dear old Woollett itself."
 
 "Oh yes," he mused--"there's always dear old Woollett itself."
 
 She waited a moment.  "The young lady mayn't find herself able to
 swallow THAT quantity.  She may think it's paying too much; she may
 weigh one thing against another."
 
 Strether, ever restless in such debates, took a vague turn "It will all
 depend on who she is.  That of course--the proved ability to deal with
 dear old Woollett, since I'm sure she does deal with it--is what makes
 so strongly for Mamie."
 
 "Mamie?"
 
 He stopped short, at her tone, before her; then, though seeing that it
 represented not vagueness, but a momentary embarrassed fulness, let his
 exclamation come.  "You surely haven't forgotten about Mamie!"
 
 "No, I haven't forgotten about Mamie," she smiled.  "There's no doubt
 whatever that there's ever so much to be said for her. Mamie's MY
 girl!" she roundly declared.
 
 Strether resumed for a minute his walk.  "She's really perfectly
 lovely, you know.  Far prettier than any girl I've seen over here yet."
 
 "That's precisely on what I perhaps most build."  And she mused a
 moment in her friend's way.  "I should positively like to take her in
--**--**--
 the course of a single sustained look and a few words of delight at
 receiving him, affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type.
 Strether had seen in museums--in the Luxembourg as well as, more
 reverently, later on, in the New York of the billionaires--the work of
 his hand; knowing too that after an earlier time in his native Rome he
 had migrated, in mid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre
 almost violent, he shone in a constellation:  all of which was more
 than enough to crown him, for his guest, with the light, with the
 romance, of glory.  Strether, in contact with that element as he had
 never yet so intimately been, had the consciousness of opening to it,
 for the happy instant, all the windows of his mind, of letting this
 rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in
 his old geography.  He was to remember again repeatedly the medal-like
 Italian face, in which every line was an artist's own, in which time
 told only as tone and consecration; and he was to recall in especial,
 as the penetrating radiance, as the communication of the illustrious
 spirit itself, the manner in which, while they stood briefly, in
 welcome and response, face to face, he was held by the sculptor's eyes.
 He wasn't soon to forget them, was to think of them, all unconscious,
 unintending, preoccupied though they were, as the source of the deepest
 intellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed.  He was in
 fact quite to cherish his vision of it, to play with it in idle hours;
 only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn't have spoken
 without appearing to talk nonsense.  Was what it had told him or what
--**--**--
 is there a better setting for it than the whole thing, the pavilion and
 the garden, together? There are lots of people with collections,"
 little Bilham smiled as he glanced round.  "You'll be secured!"
 
 It made Strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation.
 There were faces he scarce knew what to make of.  Were they charming or
 were they only strange? He mightn't talk politics, yet he suspected a
 Pole or two.  The upshot was the question at the back of his head from
 the moment his friend had joined him.  "Have Madame de Vionnet and her
 daughter arrived?"
 
 "I haven't seen them yet, but Miss Gostrey has come.  She's in the
 pavilion looking at objects.  One can see SHE'S a collector," little
 Bilham added without offence.
 
 "Oh yes, she's a collector, and I knew she was to come.  Is Madame de
 Vionnet a collector?" Strether went on.
 
 "Rather, I believe; almost celebrated."  The young man met, on it, a
 little, his friend's eyes.  "I happen to know--from Chad, whom I saw
 last night--that they've come back; but only yesterday. He wasn't
 sure--up to the last.  This, accordingly," little Bilham went on, "will
 be--if they ARE here--their first appearance after their return."
 
 Strether, very quickly, turned these things over.  "Chad told you last
 night? To me, on our way here, he said nothing about it."
 
 "But did you ask him?"
 
 Strether did him the justice.  "I dare say not."
 
 "Well," said little Bilham, "you're not a person to whom it's easy to
 tell things you don't want to know.  Though it is easy, I admit--it's
 quite beautiful," he benevolently added, "when you do want to."
 
 Strether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his
 intelligence.  "Is that the deep reasoning on which--about these
 ladies--you've been yourself so silent?"
--**--**--
 of a Christian."
 
 "Well then there we are!  Only"--and Miss Barrace appealed again to
 Strether--"don't let it discourage you.  You'll break down soon enough,
 but you'll meanwhile have had your moments.  Il faut en avoir.  I
 always like to see you while you last.  And I'll tell you who WILL
 last."
 
 "Waymarsh?"--he had already taken her up.
 
 She laughed out as at the alarm of it.  "He'll resist even Miss
 Gostrey:  so grand is it not to understand.  He's wonderful."
 
 "He is indeed," Strether conceded.  "He wouldn't tell me of this
 affair--only said he had an engagement; but with such a gloom, you must
 let me insist, as if it had been an engagement to be hanged. Then
 silently and secretly he turns up here with you.  Do you call THAT
 'lasting'?"
 
 "Oh I hope it's lasting!" Miss Barrace said.  "But he only, at the
 best, bears with me.  He doesn't understand--not one little scrap. He's
 delightful.  He's wonderful," she repeated.
 
 "Michelangelesque!"--little Bilham completed her meaning.  "He IS a
 success.  Moses, on the ceiling, brought down to the floor;
 overwhelming, colossal, but somehow portable."
 
 "Certainly, if you mean by portable," she returned, "looking so well in
 one's carriage.  He's too funny beside me in his comer; he looks like
 somebody, somebody foreign and famous, en exil; so that people
 wonder--it's very amusing--whom I'm taking about.  I show him Paris,
 show him everything, and he never turns a hair.  He's like the Indian
 chief one reads about, who, when he comes up to Washington to see the
 Great Father, stands wrapt in his blanket and gives no sign.  I might
 be the Great Father--from the way he takes everything."  She was
 delighted at this hit of her identity with that personage--it fitted so
 her character; she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to
--**--**--
 then, face to face at last; you're made for each other--vous allez
 voir; and I bless your union."  It was indeed, after he had gone off,
 as if he had been partly serious too.  This latter motion had been
 determined by an enquiry from him about "Jeanne"; to which her mother
 had replied that she was probably still in the house with Miss Gostrey,
 to whom she had lately committed her.  "Ah but you know," the young man
 had rejoined, "he must see her"; with which, while Strether pricked up
 his ears, he had started as if to bring her, leaving the other objects
 of his interest together. Strether wondered to find Miss Gostrey
 already involved, feeling that he missed a link; but feeling also, with
 small delay, how much he should like to talk with her of Madame de
 Vionnet on this basis of evidence.
 
 The evidence as yet in truth was meagre; which, for that matter, was
 perhaps a little why his expectation had had a drop.  There was somehow
 not quite a wealth in her; and a wealth was all that, in his
 simplicity, he had definitely prefigured.  Still, it was too much to be
 sure already that there was but a poverty.  They moved away from the
 house, and, with eyes on a bench at some distance, he proposed that
 they should sit down.  "I've heard a great deal about you," she said as
 they went; but he had an answer to it that made her stop short.  "Well,
 about YOU, Madame de Vionnet, I've heard, I'm bound to say, almost
 nothing"--those struck him as the only words he himself could utter
 with any lucidity; conscious as he was, and as with more reason, of the
 determination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly
--**--**--
 young man had turned quite solemn, and that this was a contradiction of
 the innocent gaiety the speaker had wished to promote.  He watched for
 a moment the consequence of his words, and then, laying a hand on his
 listener's knee and as if to end with the proper joke:  "And now for
 the eye I shall keep on you!"
 
 "Oh but I don't know that I want to be, at your age, too different from
 you!"
 
 "Ah prepare while you're about it," said Strether, "to be more amusing."
 
 Little Bilham continued to think, but at last had a smile.  "Well, you
 ARE amusing--to ME."
 
 "Impayable, as you say, no doubt.  But what am I to myself?" Strether
 had risen with this, giving his attention now to an encounter that, in
 the middle of the garden, was in the act of taking place between their
 host and the lady at whose side Madame de Vionnet had quitted him. This
 lady, who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends,
 awaited Gloriani's eager approach with words on her lips that Strether
 couldn't catch, but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give
 him the echo. He was sure she was prompt and fine, but also that she
 had met her match, and he liked--in the light of what he was quite sure
 was the Duchess's latent insolence--the good humour with which the
 great artist asserted equal resources.  Were they, this pair, of the
 "great world"?--and was he himself, for the moment and thus related to
 them by his observation, IN it? Then there was something in the great
 world covertly tigerish, which came to him across the lawn and in the
 charming air as a waft from the jungle. Yet it made him admire most of
 the two, made him envy, the glossy male tiger, magnificently marked.
--**--**--
 transplantation of her daughter.  He already saw himself discussing
 with this lady the attractions of Woollett as a residence for Chad's
 companion. Was that youth going now to trust her with the affair--so
 that it would be after all with one of his "lady-friends" that his
 mother's missionary should be condemned to deal?  It was quite as if
 for an instant the two men looked at each other on this question.  But
 there was no mistaking at last Chad's pride in the display of such a
 connexion.  This was what had made him so carry himself while, three
 minutes before, he was bringing it into view; what had caused his
 friend, first catching sight of him, to be so struck with his air.  It
 was, in a word, just when he thus finally felt Chad putting things
 straight off on him that he envied him, as he had mentioned to little
 Bilham, most.  The whole exhibition however was but a matter of three
 or four minutes, and the author of it had soon explained that, as
 Madame de Vionnet was immediately going "on," this could be for Jeanne
 but a snatch.  They would all meet again soon, and Strether was
 meanwhile to stay and amuse himself--"I'll pick you up again in plenty
 of time." He took the girl off as he had brought her, and Strether,
 with the faint sweet foreignness of her "Au revoir, monsieur!" in his
 ears as a note almost unprecedented, watched them recede side by side
 and felt how, once more, her companion's relation to her got an accent
 from it.  They disappeared among the others and apparently into the
 house; whereupon our friend turned round to give out to little Bilham
 the conviction of which he was full.  But there was no little Bilham
--**--**--
 
 She had laughed the words out, but they brought her companion, the next
 thing, to a stand.  "Is what you mean that she'll try to make a fool of
 me?"
 
 "Well, I'm wondering what she WILL--with an opportunity--make."
 
 "What do you call," Strether asked, "an opportunity?  My going to see
 her?"
 
 "Ah you must go to see her"--Miss Gostrey was a trifle evasive. "You
 can't not do that.  You'd have gone to see the other woman.  I mean if
 there had been one--a different sort.  It's what you came out for."
 
 It might be; but Strether distinguished.  "I didn't come out to see
 THIS sort."
 
 She had a wonderful look at him now.  "Are you disappointed she isn't
 worse?"
 
 He for a moment entertained the question, then found for it the
 frankest of answers.  "Yes.  If she were worse she'd be better for our
 purpose.  It would be simpler."
 
 "Perhaps," she admitted.  "But won't this be pleasanter?"
 
 "Ah you know," he promptly replied, "I didn't come out--wasn't that
 just what you originally reproached me with?--for the pleasant."
 
 "Precisely.  Therefore I say again what I said at first.  You must take
 things as they come.  Besides," Miss Gostrey added, "I'm not afraid for
 myself."
 
 "For yourself--?"
 
 "Of your seeing her.  I trust her.  There's nothing she'll say about
 me.  In fact there's nothing she CAN."
 
 Strether wondered--little as he had thought of this.  Then he broke
 out.  "Oh you women!"
 
 There was something in it at which she flushed.  "Yes--there we are.
 We're abysses." At last she smiled.  "But I risk her!"
 
 He gave himself a shake.  "Well then so do I!"  But he added as they
 passed into the house that he would see Chad the first thing in the
 morning.
 
 This was the next day the more easily effected that the young man, as
--**--**--
 was practically of positive blandness.  "Absolutely without reproach. A
 beautiful life.  Allez donc voir!"
 
 These last words were, in the liberality of their confidence, so
 imperative that Strether went through no form of assent; but before
 they separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a
 quarter to five.

 I
 
 
 It was quite by half-past five--after the two men had been together in
 Madame de Vionnet's drawing-room not more than a dozen minutes--that
 Chad, with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess, said
 genially, gaily:  "I've an engagement, and I know you won't complain if
 I leave him with you.  He'll interest you immensely; and as for her,"
 he declared to Strether, "I assure you, if you're at all nervous, she's
 perfectly safe."
 
 He had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee, as they
 could best manage, and embarrassment was a thing that Strether wasn't
 at first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped.  He escaped it himself, to his
 surprise; but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as
 brazen.  She occupied, his hostess, in the Rue de Bellechasse, the
 first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from
 an old clean court.  The court was large and open, full of revelations,
 for our friend, of the habit of privacy, the peace of intervals, the
 dignity of distances and approaches; the house, to his restless sense,
 was in the high homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris
 that he was always looking for--sometimes intensely felt, sometimes
 more acutely missed--was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed
 staircase and in the fine boiseries, the medallions, mouldings,
 mirrors, great clear spaces, of the greyish-white salon into which he
--**--**--
 He had an hesitation, but he brought the words out.  "Well, she thinks
 so now."
 
 "Do you mean by that--?" But she also hung fire.
 
 "Do I mean what?"
 
 She still rather faltered.  "Pardon me if I touch on it, but if I'm
 saying extraordinary things, why, perhaps, mayn't I?  Besides, doesn't
 it properly concern us to know?"
 
 "To know what?" he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she
 had again dropped.
 
 She made the effort.  "Has she given you up?"
 
 He was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it.
 "Not yet." It was almost as if he were a trifle disappointed--had
 expected still more of her freedom.  But he went straight on. "Is that
 what Chad has told you will happen to me?"
 
 She was evidently charmed with the way he took it.  "If you mean if
 we've talked of it--most certainly.  And the question's not what has
 had least to do with my wishing to see you."
 
 "To judge if I'm the sort of man a woman CAN--?"
 
 "Precisely," she exclaimed--"you wonderful gentleman! I do judge--I
 HAVE judged.  A woman can't.  You're safe--with every right to be.
 You'd be much happier if you'd only believe it."
 
 Strether was silent a little; then he found himself speaking with a
 cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were
 strange to him.  "I try to believe it.  But it's a marvel," he
 exclaimed, "how YOU already get at it!"
 
 Oh she was able to say.  "Remember how much I was on the way to it
 through Mr. Newsome--before I saw you.  He thinks everything of your
 strength."
 
 "Well, I can bear almost anything!" our friend briskly interrupted.
 Deep and beautiful on this her smile came back, and with the effect of
--**--**--
 was bearing hard, it was bearing as HE, in any case, wouldn't bear, to
 concern himself, in relation to her, with the question of a young man.
 Odious really the question of a young man; one didn't treat such a
 person as a maid-servant suspected of a "follower."  And then young
 men, young men--well, the thing was their business simply, or was at
 all events hers.  She was fluttered, fairly fevered--to the point of a
 little glitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots
 that stayed in her cheeks--with the great adventure of dining out and
 with the greater one still, possibly, of finding a gentleman whom she
 must think of as very, very old, a gentleman with eye-glasses,
 wrinkles, a long grizzled moustache.  She spoke the prettiest English,
 our friend thought, that he had ever heard spoken, just as he had
 believed her a few minutes before to be speaking the prettiest French.
 He wondered almost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didn't react
 on the spirit itself; and his fancy had in fact, before he knew it,
 begun so to stray and embroider that he finally found himself, absent
 and extravagant, sitting with the child in a friendly silence.  Only by
 this time he felt her flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she
 was more at her ease.  She trusted him, liked him, and it was to come
 back to him afterwards that she had told him things.  She had dipped
 into the waiting medium at last and found neither surge nor
 chill--nothing but the small splash she could herself make in the
 pleasant warmth, nothing but the safety of dipping and dipping again.
 At the end of the ten minutes he was to spend with her his
--**--**--
 "I've met him.  He's bien aimable."
 
 "To every one but his wife?"
 
 "Oh for all I know, to her too--to any, to every woman.  I hope you at
 any rate," she pursued with a quick change, "appreciate the care I take
 of Mr. Waymarsh."
 
 "Oh immensely." But Strether was not yet in line.  "At all events," he
 roundly brought out, "the attachment's an innocent one."
 
 "Mine and his?  Ah," she laughed, "don't rob it of ALL interest!"
 
 "I mean our friend's here--to the lady we've been speaking of." That
 was what he had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely
 involved consequence of his impression of Jeanne.  That was where he
 meant to stay.  "It's innocent," he repeated--"I see the whole thing."
 
 Mystified by his abrupt declaration, she had glanced over at Gloriani
 as at the unnamed subject of his allusion, but the next moment she had
 understood; though indeed not before Strether had noticed her momentary
 mistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too.  He
 already knew that the sculptor admired Madame de Vionnet; but did this
 admiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was
 discussable?  He was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not
 of the firmest.  He looked hard for an instant at Miss Barrace, but she
 had already gone on.  "All right with Mr. Newsome?  Why of course she
 is!"--and she got gaily back to the question of her own good friend. "I
 dare say you're surprised that I'm not worn out with all I see--it
 being so much!--of Sitting Bull.  But I'm not, you know--I don't mind
 him; I bear up, and we get on beautifully.  I'm very strange; I'm like
 that; and often I can't explain.  There are people who are supposed
 interesting or remarkable or whatever, and who bore me to death; and
--**--**--
 "Ah that's another question!" she smiled.  "The point is of what use is
 your declining to know me when to know Mr. Newsome--as you do me the
 honour to find him--IS just to know me."
 
 "I see," he mused, still with his eyes on her.  "I shouldn't have met
 you to-night."
 
 She raised and dropped her linked hands.  "It doesn't matter.  If I
 trust you why can't you a little trust me too?  And why can't you
 also," she asked in another tone, "trust yourself?"  But she gave him
 no time to reply.  "Oh I shall be so easy for you! And I'm glad at any
 rate you've seen my child."
 
 "I'm glad too," he said; "but she does you no good."
 
 "No good?"--Madame de Vionnet had a clear stare.  "Why she's an angel
 of light."
 
 "That's precisely the reason.  Leave her alone.  Don't try to find out.
 I mean," he explained, "about what you spoke to me of--the way she
 feels."
 
 His companion wondered.  "Because one really won't?"
 
 "Well, because I ask you, as a favour to myself, not to.  She's the
 most charming creature I've ever seen.  Therefore don't touch her.
 Don't know--don't want to know.  And moreover--yes--you won't."
 
 It was an appeal, of a sudden, and she took it in.  "As a favour to
 you?"
 
 "Well--since you ask me."
 
 "Anything, everything you ask," she smiled.  "I shan't know
 then--never. Thank you," she added with peculiar gentleness as she
 turned away.
 
 The sound of it lingered with him, making him fairly feel as if he had
 been tripped up and had a fall.  In the very act of arranging with her
 for his independence he had, under pressure from a particular
 perception, inconsistently, quite stupidly, committed himself, and,
 with her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage, she had driven
--**--**--
 
 Strether's theory that it was none of his business was somehow not
 damaged by the way he took this.  "More, you mean, than he?"  On which
 his companion looked round at him, and now for an instant their eyes
 met.  "More than he?" he repeated.
 
 Little Bilham, for as long, hung fire.  "Will you never tell any one?"
 
 Strether thought.  "Whom should I tell?"
 
 "Why I supposed you reported regularly--"
 
 "To people at home?"--Strether took him up.  "Well, I won't tell them
 this."
 
 The young man at last looked away.  "Then she does now care more than
 he."
 
 "Oh!" Strether oddly exclaimed.
 
 But his companion immediately met it.  "Haven't you after all had your
 impression of it?  That's how you've got hold of him."
 
 "Ah but I haven't got hold of him!"
 
 "Oh I say!"  But it was all little Bilham said.
 
 "It's at any rate none of my business.  I mean," Strether explained,
 "nothing else than getting hold of him is."  It appeared, however, to
 strike him as his business to add:  "The fact remains nevertheless that
 she has saved him."
 
 Little Bilham just waited.  "I thought that was what you were to do."
 
 But Strether had his answer ready.  "I'm speaking--in connexion with
 her--of his manners and morals, his character and life.  I'm speaking
 of him as a person to deal with and talk with and live with--speaking
 of him as a social animal."
 
 "And isn't it as a social animal that you also want him?"
 
 "Certainly; so that it's as if she had saved him FOR us."
 
 "It strikes you accordingly then," the young man threw out, "as for you
 all to save HER?"
 
 "Oh for us 'all'--!" Strether could but laugh at that.  It brought him
 back, however, to the point he had really wished to make. "They've
--**--**--
 wholly given up to the need, whatever it was, that had brought her
 there.  She only sat and gazed before her, as he himself often sat; but
 she had placed herself, as he never did, within the focus of the
 shrine, and she had lost herself, he could easily see, as he would only
 have liked to do. She was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than
 she gave, but one of the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for
 whom these dealings had a method and a meaning.  She reminded our
 friend--since it was the way of nine tenths of his current impressions
 to act as recalls of things imagined--of some fine firm concentrated
 heroine of an old story, something he had heard, read, something that,
 had he had a hand for drama, he might himself have written, renewing
 her courage, renewing her clearness, in splendidly-protected
 meditation.  Her back, as she sat, was turned to him, but his
 impression absolutely required that she should be young and
 interesting, and she carried her head moreover, even in the sacred
 shade, with a discernible faith in herself, a kind of implied
 conviction of consistency, security, impunity.  But what had such a
 woman come for if she hadn't come to pray?  Strether's reading of such
 matters was, it must be owned, confused; but he wondered if her
 attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution, of "indulgence."  He
 knew but dimly what indulgence, in such a place, might mean; yet he
 had, as with a soft sweep, a vision of how it might indeed add to the
 zest of active rites.  All this was a good deal to have been denoted by
 a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him; but, the last thing
 before leaving the church, he had the surprise of a still deeper
--**--**--
 his impression must remain a secret from her.  The thing that, once
 more, made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular
 patience she could have with his own want of colour; albeit that on the
 other hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten
 minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive.
 
 The moments had already, for that matter, drawn their deepest tinge
 from the special interest excited in him by his vision of his
 companion's identity with the person whose attitude before the
 glimmering altar had so impressed him.  This attitude fitted admirably
 into the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with Chad on
 the last occasion of his seeing them together.  It helped him to stick
 fast at the point he had then reached; it was there he had resolved
 that he WOULD stick, and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do
 so.  Unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the
 parties to it so carry herself. If it wasn't innocent why did she haunt
 the churches?--into which, given the woman he could believe he made
 out, she would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt.  She
 haunted them for continued help, for strength, for peace--sublime
 support which, if one were able to look at it so, she found from day to
 day.  They talked, in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks,
 about the great monument and its history and its beauty--all of which,
 Madame de Vionnet professed, came to her most in the other, the outer
 view.  "We'll presently, after we go," she said, "walk round it again
 if you like.  I'm not in a particular hurry, and it will be pleasant to
--**--**--
 perhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of
 pride--so fine, so odd a case, at any rate, as his finding himself thus
 able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new, a rare
 amusement.  She had heard of the happy spot, but she asked him in reply
 to a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have
 been there.  He supposed himself to have supposed that Chad might have
 taken her, and she guessed this the next moment to his no small
 discomfort.
 
 "Ah, let me explain," she smiled, "that I don't go about with him in
 public; I never have such chances--not having them otherwise--and it's
 just the sort of thing that, as a quiet creature living in my hole, I
 adore."  It was more than kind of him to have thought of it--though,
 frankly, if he asked whether she had time she hadn't a single minute.
 That however made no difference--she'd throw everything over.  Every
 duty at home, domestic, maternal, social, awaited her; but it was a
 case for a high line.  Her affairs would go to smash, but hadn't one a
 right to one's snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay?  It was
 on this pleasant basis of costly disorder, consequently, that they
 eventually seated themselves, on either side of a small table, at a
 window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining barge-burdened Seine;
 where, for an hour, in the matter of letting himself go, of diving
 deep, Strether was to feel he had touched bottom.  He was to feel many
 things on this occasion, and one of the first of them was that he had
 travelled far since that evening in London, before the theatre, when
 his dinner with Maria Gostrey, between the pink-shaded candles, had
--**--**--
 Mrs. Newsome about you, and I'm at last, from one day to the other,
 expecting her answer.  It's this answer that will represent, as I
 believe, the consequences."
 
 Patient and beautiful was her interest.  "I see--the consequences of
 your speaking for me."  And she waited as if not to hustle him.
 
 He acknowledged it by immediately going on.  "The question, you
 understand, was HOW I should save you.  Well, I'm trying it by thus
 letting her know that I consider you worth saving."
 
 "I see--I see."  Her eagerness broke through.
 
 "How can I thank you enough?"  He couldn't tell her that, however, and
 she quickly pursued.  "You do really, for yourself, consider it?"
 
 His only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been
 freshly put before them.  "I've written to her again since then--I've
 left her in no doubt of what I think.  I've told her all about you."
 
 "Thanks--not so much.  'All about' me," she went on--"yes."
 
 "All it seems to me you've done for him."
 
 "Ah and you might have added all it seems to ME!"  She laughed again,
 while she took up her knife and fork, as in the cheer of these
 assurances.  "But you're not sure how she'll take it."
 
 "No, I'll not pretend I'm sure."
 
 "Voila."  And she waited a moment.  "I wish you'd tell me about her."
 
 "Oh," said Strether with a slightly strained smile, "all that need
 concern you about her is that she's really a grand person."
 
 Madame de Vionnet seemed to demur.  "Is that all that need concern me
 about her?"
 
 But Strether neglected the question.  "Hasn't Chad talked to you?"
 
 "Of his mother?  Yes, a great deal--immensely.  But not from your point
 of view."
 
 "He can't," our friend returned, "have said any ill of her."
--**--**--
 same."
 
 She shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom.  "You're not ready. If
 you're ready why did you write to Mrs. Newsome in the sense you've
 mentioned to me?"
 
 Strether considered.  "I shan't go before I hear from her.  You're too
 much afraid of her," he added.
 
 It produced between them a long look from which neither shrank.  "I
 don't think you believe that--believe I've not really reason to fear
 her."
 
 "She's capable of great generosity," Strether presently stated.
 
 "Well then let her trust me a little.  That's all I ask.  Let her
 recognise in spite of everything what I've done."
 
 "Ah remember," our friend replied, "that she can't effectually
 recognise it without seeing it for herself.  Let Chad go over and show
 her what you've done, and let him plead with her there for it and, as
 it were, for YOU."
 
 She measured the depth of this suggestion.  "Do you give me your word
 of honour that if she once has him there she won't do her best to marry
 him?"
 
 It made her companion, this enquiry, look again a while out at the
 view; after which he spoke without sharpness.  "When she sees for
 herself what he is--"
 
 But she had already broken in.  "It's when she sees for herself what he
 is that she'll want to marry him most."
 
 Strether's attitude, that of due deference to what she said, permitted
 him to attend for a minute to his luncheon.  "I doubt if that will come
 off.  It won't be easy to make it."
 
 "It will be easy if he remains there--and he'll remain for the money.
 The money appears to be, as a probability, so hideously much."
 
 "Well," Strether presently concluded, "nothing COULD really hurt you
 but his marrying."
 
 She gave a strange light laugh.  "Putting aside what may really hurt
--**--**--
 reason then that we should start straight off."
 
 Strether had now got together hat, gloves and stick, but Chad had
 dropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point. He
 kept observing his companion's things; he might have been judging how
 quickly they could be packed.  He might even have wished to hint that
 he'd send his own servant to assist.  "What do you mean," Strether
 enquired, "by 'straight off'?"
 
 "Oh by one of next week's boats.  Everything at this season goes out so
 light that berths will be easy anywhere."
 
 Strether had in his hand his telegram, which he had kept there after
 attaching his watch, and he now offered it to Chad, who, however, with
 an odd movement, declined to take it.  "Thanks, I'd rather not.  Your
 correspondence with Mother's your own affair.  I'm only WITH you both
 on it, whatever it is."  Strether, at this, while their eyes met,
 slowly folded the missive and put it in his pocket; after which, before
 he had spoken again, Chad broke fresh ground. "Has Miss Gostrey come
 back?"
 
 But when Strether presently spoke it wasn't in answer.  "It's not, I
 gather, that your mother's physically ill; her health, on the whole,
 this spring, seems to have been better than usual.  But she's worried,
 she's anxious, and it appears to have risen within the last few days to
 a climax.  We've tired out, between us, her patience."
 
 "Oh it isn't YOU!" Chad generously protested.
 
 "I beg your pardon--it IS me."  Strether was mild and melancholy, but
 firm.  He saw it far away and over his companion's head.  "It's very
 particularly me."
 
 "Well then all the more reason.  Marchons, marchons!" said the young
 man gaily.  His host, however, at this, but continued to stand agaze;
--**--**--
 
 Strether, who uttered this with serenity, had urged a plea for their
 now getting into the air; but the young man still waited.  "Have you
 sent your answer?"
 
 "No, I've done nothing yet."
 
 "Were you waiting to see me?"
 
 "No, not that."
 
 "Only waiting"--and Chad, with this, had a smile for him--"to see Miss
 Gostrey?"
 
 "No--not even Miss Gostrey.  I wasn't waiting to see any one.  I had
 only waited, till now, to make up my mind--in complete solitude; and,
 since I of course absolutely owe you the information, was on the point
 of going out with it quite made up.  Have therefore a little more
 patience with me.  Remember," Strether went on, "that that's what you
 originally asked ME to have.  I've had it, you see, and you see what
 has come of it.  Stay on with me."
 
 Chad looked grave.  "How much longer?"
 
 "Well, till I make you a sign.  I can't myself, you know, at the best,
 or at the worst, stay for ever.  Let the Pococks come," Strether
 repeated.
 
 "Because it gains you time?"
 
 "Yes--it gains me time."
 
 Chad, as if it still puzzled him, waited a minute.  "You don't want to
 get back to Mother?"
 
 "Not just yet.  I'm not ready."
 
 "You feel," Chad asked in a tone of his own, "the charm of life over
 here?"
 
 "Immensely."  Strether faced it.  "You've helped me so to feel it that
 that surely needn't surprise you."
 
 "No, it doesn't surprise me, and I'm delighted.  But what, my dear
 man," Chad went on with conscious queerness, "does it all lead to for
 you?"
 
 The change of position and of relation, for each, was so oddly betrayed
 in the question that Chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered
 it--which made Strether also laugh.  "Well, to my having a certitude
--**--**--
 SHE wants it."
 
 Strether thought a minute.  "Well then if those things are really your
 motive catch the French steamer and sail to-morrow.  Of course, when it
 comes to that, you're absolutely free to do as you choose. From the
 moment you can't hold yourself I can only accept your flight."
 
 "I'll fly in a minute then," said Chad, "if you'll stay here."
 
 "I'll stay here till the next steamer--then I'll follow you."
 
 "And do you call that," Chad asked, "accepting my flight?"
 
 "Certainly--it's the only thing to call it.  The only way to keep me
 here, accordingly," Strether explained, "is by staying yourself."
 
 Chad took it in.  "All the more that I've really dished you, eh?"
 
 "Dished me?" Strether echoed as inexpressively as possible.
 
 "Why if she sends out the Pococks it will be that she doesn't trust
 you, and if she doesn't trust you, that bears upon--well, you know
 what."
 
 Strether decided after a moment that he did know what, and in
 consonance with this he spoke.  "You see then all the more what you owe
 me."
 
 "Well, if I do see, how can I pay?"
 
 "By not deserting me.  By standing by me."
 
 "Oh I say--!"  But Chad, as they went downstairs, clapped a firm hand,
 in the manner of a pledge, upon his shoulder.  They descended slowly
 together and had, in the court of the hotel, some further talk, of
 which the upshot was that they presently separated.  Chad Newsome
 departed, and Strether, left alone, looked about, superficially, for
 Waymarsh.  But Waymarsh hadn't yet, it appeared, come down, and our
 friend finally went forth without sight of him.

 At four o'clock that afternoon he had still not seen him, but he was
 then, as to make up for this, engaged in talk about him with Miss
--**--**--
 She made it out.  "By bringing things to a head?"
 
 "How well you understand!" he almost groaned.  "Waymarsh won't in the
 least, at any rate, when I have it out with him, deny or extenuate.  He
 has acted from the deepest conviction, with the best conscience and
 after wakeful nights.  He'll recognise that he's fully responsible, and
 will consider that he has been highly successful; so that any
 discussion we may have will bring us quite together again--bridge the
 dark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart.  We shall have at
 last, in the consequences of his act, something we can definitely talk
 about."
 
 She was silent a little.  "How wonderfully you take it! But you're
 always wonderful."
 
 He had a pause that matched her own; then he had, with an adequate
 spirit, a complete admission.  "It's quite true.  I'm extremely
 wonderful just now.  I dare say in fact I'm quite fantastic, and I
 shouldn't be at all surprised if I were mad."
 
 "Then tell me!" she earnestly pressed.  As he, however, for the time
 answered nothing, only returning the look with which she watched him,
 she presented herself where it was easier to meet her.  "What will Mr.
 Waymarsh exactly have done?"
 
 "Simply have written a letter.  One will have been quite enough.  He
 has told them I want looking after."
 
 "And DO you?"--she was all interest.
 
 "Immensely.  And I shall get it."
 
 "By which you mean you don't budge?"
 
 "I don't budge."
 
 "You've cabled?"
 
 "No--I've made Chad do it."
 
 "That you decline to come?"
 
 "That HE declines.  We had it out this morning and I brought him round.
 He had come in, before I was down, to tell me he was ready--ready, I
 mean, to return.  And he went off, after ten minutes with me, to say he
--**--**--
 They had, in the matter that so much interested them, come so far as
 this without sounding another name--to which however their present
 momentary silence was full of a conscious reference. Strether's
 question was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with
 him during the absence of his hostess; and just for that reason a
 single gesture from her could pass for him as a vivid answer.  Yet he
 was answered still better when she said in a moment: "Will Mr. Newsome
 introduce his sister--?"
 
 "To Madame de Vionnet?"  Strether spoke the name at last.  "I shall be
 greatly surprised if he doesn't."
 
 She seemed to gaze at the possibility.  "You mean you've thought of it
 and you're prepared."
 
 "I've thought of it and I'm prepared."
 
 It was to her visitor now that she applied her consideration.  "Bon!
 You ARE magnificent!"
 
 "Well," he answered after a pause and a little wearily, but still
 standing there before her--"well, that's what, just once in all my dull
 days, I think I shall like to have been!"
 
 Two days later he had news from Chad of a communication from Woollett
 in response to their determinant telegram, this missive being addressed
 to Chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for France of
 Sarah and Jim and Mamie.  Strether had meanwhile on his own side
 cabled; he had but delayed that act till after his visit to Miss
 Gostrey, an interview by which, as so often before, he felt his sense
 of things cleared up and settled.  His message to Mrs. Newsome, in
 answer to her own, had consisted of the words: "Judge best to take
 another month, but with full appreciation of all re-enforcements."  He
 had added that he was writing, but he was of course always writing; it
 was a practice that continued, oddly enough, to relieve him, to make
--**--**--
 logic to pay for it he was literally impatient to know the cost, and he
 held himself ready to pay in instalments.  The first instalment would
 be precisely this entertainment of Sarah; as a consequence of which
 moreover, he should know vastly better how he stood.

 Strether rambled alone during these few days, the effect of the
 incident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked
 fashion his mixed relations with Waymarsh.  Nothing had passed between
 them in reference to Mrs. Newsome's summons but that our friend had
 mentioned to his own the departure of the deputation actually at
 sea--giving him thus an opportunity to confess to the occult
 intervention he imputed to him.  Waymarsh however in the event
 confessed to nothing; and though this falsified in some degree
 Strether's forecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of
 good conscience out of which the dear man's impertinence had originally
 sprung.  He was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe
 how unmistakeably he had put on flesh; he felt his own holiday so
 successfully large and free that he was full of allowances and
 charities in respect to those cabined and confined' his instinct toward
 a spirit so strapped down as Waymarsh's was to walk round it on tiptoe
 for fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time
 irretrievable.  It was all very funny he knew, and but the difference,
 as he often said to himself, of tweedledum and tweedledee--an
 emancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the
 door-mat on the scraper; yet the present crisis was happily to profit
 by it and the pilgrim from Milrose to know himself more than ever in
 the right.
 
 Strether felt that when he heard of the approach of the Pococks the
--**--**--
 bearing of such a fact on the youth's view of his relatives.  As it
 came up between them that they might now take their friend for a
 feature of the control of these latter now sought to be exerted from
 Woollett, Strether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him,
 half an hour later for Sarah Pocock's eyes, that he was as much on
 Chad's "side" as Waymarsh had probably described him.  He was letting
 himself at present, go; there was no denying it; it might be
 desperation, it might be confidence; he should offer himself to the
 arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated.
 
 He repeated to Chad what he had been saying in the court to Waymarsh;
 how there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a
 kindred spirit, no doubt of the alliance, based on an exchange of
 views, that the pair would successfully strike up.  They would become
 as thick as thieves--which moreover was but a development of what
 Strether remembered to have said in one of his first discussions with
 his mate, struck as he had then already been with the elements of
 affinity between that personage and Mrs. Newsome herself.  "I told him,
 one day, when he had questioned me on your mother, that she was a
 person who, when he should know her, would rouse in him, I was sure, a
 special enthusiasm; and that hangs together with the conviction we now
 feel--this certitude that Mrs. Pocock will take him into her boat.  For
 it's your mother's own boat that she's pulling."
 
 "Ah," said Chad, "Mother's worth fifty of Sally!"
 
 "A thousand; but when you presently meet her, all the same you'll be
 meeting your mother's representative--just as I shall.  I feel like the
--**--**--
 
 "Ah what DOES your mother think?"  There was in this some sound of
 bewilderment.
 
 But they were just driving up, and help, of a sort, might after all be
 quite at hand.  "Isn't that, my dear man, what we're both just going to
 make out?"

 Strether quitted the station half an hour later in different company.
 Chad had taken charge, for the journey to the hotel, of Sarah, Mamie,
 the maid and the luggage, all spaciously installed and conveyed; and it
 was only after the four had rolled away that his companion got into a
 cab with Jim.  A strange new feeling had come over Strether, in
 consequence of which his spirits had risen; it was as if what had
 occurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than
 his fear, though his fear had vet not been of an instant scene of
 violence.  His impression had been nothing but what was inevitable--he
 said that to himself; yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped
 upon him.  Nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things
 to the look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him to
 satiety, as he might have said, for years; but he now knew, all the
 same, how uneasy he had felt; that was brought home to him by his
 present sense of a respite.  It had come moreover in the flash of an
 eye, it had come in the smile with which Sarah, whom, at the window of
 her compartment, they had effusively greeted from the platform, rustled
 down to them a moment later, fresh and handsome from her cool June
 progress through the charming land.  It was only a sign, but enough:
 she was going to be gracious and unallusive, she was going to play the
--**--**--
 been so happy a manifestation.  Strether liked him for it, on the spot,
 as he hadn't yet liked him; it affected him while it lasted as he might
 have been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art:  to that
 degree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it, took it in
 and did it justice; to that degree that it would have been scarce a
 miracle if, there in the luggage-room, while they waited for their
 things, Sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside. "You're right;
 we haven't quite known what you mean, Mother and I, but now we see.
 Chad's magnificent; what can one want more?  If THIS is the kind of
 thing--!"  On which they might, as it were, have embraced and begun to
 work together.
 
 Ah how much, as it was, for all her bridling brightness--which was
 merely general and noticed nothing--WOULD they work together? Strether
 knew he was unreasonable; he set it down to his being nervous:  people
 couldn't notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an
 hour.  Possibly, no doubt, also, he made too much of Chad's display.
 Yet, none the less, when, at the end of five minutes, in the cab, Jim
 Pocock had said nothing either--hadn't said, that is, what Strether
 wanted, though he had said much else--it all suddenly bounced back to
 their being either stupid or wilful.  It was more probably on the whole
 the former; so that that would be the drawback of the bridling
 brightness.  Yes, they would bridle and be bright; they would make the
 best of what was before them, but their observation would fail; it
 would be beyond them; they simply wouldn't understand.  Of what use
 would it be then that they had come?--if they weren't to be intelligent
--**--**--
 that she never gives herself away, any more than her mother ever does?
 They ain't fierce, either of 'em; they let you come quite close.  They
 wear their fur the smooth side out--the warm side in. Do you know what
 they are?" Jim pursued as he looked about him, giving the question, as
 Strether felt, but half his care--"do you know what they are?  They're
 about as intense as they can live."
 
 "Yes"--and Strether's concurrence had a positive precipitation;
 "they're about as intense as they can live."
 
 "They don't lash about and shake the cage," said Jim, who seemed
 pleased with his analogy; "and it's at feeding-time that they're
 quietest.  But they always get there."
 
 "They do indeed--they always get there!" Strether replied with a laugh
 that justified his confession of nervousness.  He disliked to be
 talking sincerely of Mrs.  Newsome with Pocock; he could have talked
 insincerely.  But there was something he wanted to know, a need created
 in him by her recent intermission, by his having given from the first
 so much, as now more than ever appeared to him, and got so little.  It
 was as if a queer truth in his companion's metaphor had rolled over him
 with a rush.  She HAD been quiet at feeding-time; she had fed, and
 Sarah had fed with her, out of the big bowl of all his recent free
 communication, his vividness and pleasantness, his ingenuity and even
 his eloquence, while the current of her response had steadily run thin.
 Jim meanwhile however, it was true, slipped characteristically into
 shallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of
 a husband.
 
 "But of course Chad has now the advantage of being there before her. If
 he doesn't work that for all it's worth--!"  He sighed with contingent
--**--**--
 after all, she COULD strike from the moment she presented herself at
 all.  She could meet Mrs. Pocock only on the ground of the obvious, and
 what feature of Chad's situation was more eminent than the fact that he
 had created for himself a new set of circumstances?  Unless she hid
 herself altogether she could show but as one of these, an illustration
 of his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition.  And the
 consciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine
 that as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him
 such a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as
 pusillanimous.  "Ah don't be so charming to me!--for it makes us
 intimate, and after all what IS between us when I've been so
 tremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times?"  He
 recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his
 poor personal aspects:  it would be exactly LIKE the way things always
 turned out for him that he should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as
 launched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at
 all. They were at this very moment--they could only be--attributing to
 him the full licence of it, and all by the operation of her own tone
 with him; whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to
 the brink, not to dip so much as a toe into the flood. But the flicker
 of his fear on this occasion was not, as may be added, to repeat
 itself; it sprang up, for its moment, only to die down and then go out
 for ever.  To meet his fellow visitor's invocation and, with Sarah's
 brilliant eyes on him, answer, WAS quite sufficiently to step into her
--**--**--
 it came to Strether that of the two, at this moment, she was the one
 who most carried out the idea of a Countess.  He quite took in,
 however, that she would really return her visitor's civility:  she
 wouldn't report again at Woollett without at least so much producible
 history as that in her pocket.
 
 "I want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter." Madame de
 Vionnet went on; "and I should have brought her with me if I hadn't
 wished first to ask your leave.  I was in hopes I should perhaps find
 Miss Pocock, of whose being with you I've heard from Mr. Newsome and
 whose acquaintance I should so much like my child to make.  If I have
 the pleasure of seeing her and you do permit it I shall venture to ask
 her to be kind to Jeanne.  Mr. Strether will tell you"--she beautifully
 kept it up--"that my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely.
 They've made friends, he and she, ever so happily, and he doesn't, I
 believe, think ill of her.  As for Jeanne herself he has had the same
 success with her that I know he has had here wherever he has turned."
 She seemed to ask him for permission to say these things, or seemed
 rather to take it, softly and happily, with the ease of intimacy, for
 granted, and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at
 any point more than halfway would be odiously, basely to abandon her.
 Yes, he was WITH her, and, opposed even in this covert, this semi-safe
 fashion to those who were not, he felt, strangely and confusedly, but
 excitedly, inspiringly, how much and how far.  It was as if he had
 positively waited in suspense for something from her that would let him
--**--**--
 "I DID hope so much also to see Miss Pocock. Mayn't I still?"
 
 Sarah hesitated, but she rose equal.  "She'll return your visit with
 me.  She's at present out with Mr. Pocock and my brother."
 
 "I see--of course Mr. Newsome has everything to show them.  He has told
 me so much about her.  My great desire's to give my daughter the
 opportunity of making her acquaintance.  I'm always on the lookout for
 such chances for her.  If I didn't bring her to-day it was only to make
 sure first that you'd let me." After which the charming woman risked a
 more intense appeal.  "It wouldn't suit you also to mention some near
 time, so that we shall be sure not to lose you?"  Strether on his side
 waited, for Sarah likewise had, after all, to perform; and it occupied
 him to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at home--and on her
 first morning of Paris--while Chad led the others forth.  Oh she was up
 to her eyes; if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an
 understanding, arrived at the evening before, that Waymarsh would come
 and find her alone.  This was beginning well--for a first day in Paris;
 and the thing might be amusing yet.  But Madame de Vionnet's
 earnestness was meanwhile beautiful.  "You may think me indiscreet, but
 I've SUCH a desire my Jeanne shall know an American girl of the really
 delightful kind.  You see I throw myself for it on your charity."
 
 The manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of depths below it
 and behind it as he hadn't yet had--ministered in a way that almost
 frightened him to his dim divinations of reasons; but if Sarah still,
 in spite of it, faltered, this was why he had time for a sign of
--**--**--
 Pocock's advantage." No, no; though there was a queer present
 temptation in it, and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a
 relief, he wouldn't talk to her about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn't work off
 on her the anxiety produced in him by Sarah's calculated omissions of
 reference.  The effect she produced of representing her mother had been
 produced--and that was just the immense, the uncanny part of
 it--without her having so much as mentioned that lady.  She had brought
 no message, had alluded to no question, had only answered his enquiries
 with hopeless limited propriety.  She had invented a way of meeting
 them--as if he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation, of distant
 degree--that made them almost ridiculous in him.  He couldn't moreover
 on his own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately
 lacked news; a circumstance of which it was Sarah's profound policy not
 to betray a suspicion.  These things, all the same, he wouldn't breathe
 to Madame de Vionnet--much as they might make him walk up and down. And
 what he didn't say--as well as what SHE didn't, for she had also her
 high decencies--enhanced the effect of his being there with her at the
 end of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he
 had yet had occasion to be.  It ended in fact by being quite beautiful
 between them, the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of
 not saying.  He would have liked to turn her, critically, to the
 subject of Mrs. Pocock, but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the
 point of honour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her
 personal impression had been. He knew it, for that matter, without
 putting her to trouble: that she wondered how, with such elements,
