 his degree and left Christminster."
 
 "You saw a good deal of him, I suppose?"
 
 "Yes.  We used to go about together--on walking tours, reading tours,
 and things of that sort--like two men almost.  He asked me to live
 with him, and I agreed to by letter.  But when I joined him in London
 I found he meant a different thing from what I meant.  He wanted me
 to be his mistress, in fact, but I wasn't in love with him--and on
 my saying I should go away if he didn't agree to MY plan, he did
 so.  We shared a sitting-room for fifteen months; and he became a
 leader-writer for one of the great London dailies; till he was taken
 ill, and had to go abroad.  He said I was breaking his heart by
 holding out against him so long at such close quarters; he could
 never have believed it of woman.  I might play that game once too
 often, he said.  He came home merely to die.  His death caused a
 terrible remorse in me for my cruelty--though I hope he died of
 consumption and not of me entirely.  I went down to Sandbourne
 to his funeral, and was his only mourner.  He left me a little
 money--because I broke his heart, I suppose.  That's how men
 are--so much better than women!"
 
 "Good heavens!--what did you do then?"
 
 "Ah--now you are angry with me!" she said, a contralto note of
 tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice.  "I wouldn't have
 told you if I had known!"
 
 "No, I am not.  Tell me all."
 
 "Well, I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and
 lost it.  I lived about London by myself for some time, and then I
 returned to Christminster, as my father-- who was also in London, and
--**--**--
 
 "I have no respect for Christminster whatever, except, in a qualified
 degree, on its intellectual side," said Sue Bridehead earnestly.  "My
 friend I spoke of took that out of me.  He was the most irreligious
 man I ever knew, and the most moral.  And intellect at Christminster
 is new wine in old bottles.  The medi√¶valism of Christminster must
 go, be sloughed off, or Christminster itself will have to go.  To
 be sure, at times one couldn't help having a sneaking liking for
 the traditions of the old faith, as preserved by a section of the
 thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity; but when I was in my
 saddest, rightest mind I always felt,
 
 
    'O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!'"...
 
 
 "Sue, you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that!"
 
 "Then I won't, dear Jude!"  The emotional throat-note had come back,
 and she turned her face away.
 
 "I still think Christminster has much that is glorious; though I
 was resentful because I couldn't get there."  He spoke gently, and
 resisted his impulse to pique her on to tears.
 
 "It is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,
 drunkards, and paupers," she said, perverse still at his differing
 from her.  "THEY see life as it is, of course; but few of the people
 in the colleges do.  You prove it in your own person.  You are one
 of the very men Christminster was intended for when the colleges
 were founded; a man with a passion for learning, but no money, or
 opportunities, or friends.  But you were elbowed off the pavement
 by the millionaires' sons."
 
 "Well, I can do without what it confers.  I care for something
 higher."
 
 "And I for something broader, truer," she insisted.  "At present
 intellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the
--**--**--
 likes--I shall do just as I choose!"
 
 "But you just this moment said--"
 
 "Well, if I did, I shall do as I like for all him!  I have thought of
 what I shall do--go to the sister of one of my fellow-students in the
 training-school, who has asked me to visit her.  She has a school
 near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here--and I shall stay there
 till this has blown over, and I get back to the training-school
 again."
 
 At the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of
 coffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising
 to go to his work every day before the household was astir.
 
 "Now a dew-bit to eat with it," he said; "and off we go.  You can
 have a regular breakfast when you get there."
 
 They went quietly out of the house, Jude accompanying her to the
 station.  As they departed along the street a head was thrust out
 of an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn.  Sue still
 seemed sorry for her rashness, and to wish she had not rebelled;
 telling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she
 got re-admitted to the training-school.  They stood rather miserably
 together on the platform; and it was apparent that he wanted to say
 more.
 
 "I want to tell you something--two things," he said hurriedly as the
 train came up.  "One is a warm one, the other a cold one!"
 
 "Jude," she said.  "I know one of them.  And you mustn't!"
 
 "What?"
 
 "You mustn't love me.  You are to like me--that's all!"
 
 Jude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was
 agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage
 window.  And then the train moved on, and waving her pretty hand to
--**--**--
 given over to study, he was not exactly studying.
 
 The interior of the room--the books, the furniture, the
 schoolmaster's loose coat, his attitude at the table, even the
 flickering of the fire, bespoke the same dignified tale of
 undistracted research--more than creditable to a man who had had no
 advantages beyond those of his own making.  And yet the tale, true
 enough till latterly, was not true now.  What he was regarding was
 not history.  They were historic notes, written in a bold womanly
 hand at his dictation some months before, and it was the clerical
 rendering of word after word that absorbed him.
 
 He presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,
 few, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays.  Each was in its
 envelope just as it had arrived, and the handwriting was of the same
 womanly character as the historic notes.  He unfolded them one by
 one and read them musingly. At first sight there seemed in these
 small documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over.  They were
 straightforward, frank letters, signed "Sue B--"; just such ones as
 would be written during short absences, with no other thought than
 their speedy destruction, and chiefly concerning books in reading
 and other experiences of a training school, forgotten doubtless by
 the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing.  In one of
 them--quite a recent note--the young woman said that she had received
 his considerate letter, and that it was honourable and generous of
 him to say he would not come to see her oftener than she desired (the
 school being such an awkward place for callers, and because of her
 strong wish that her engagement to him should not be known, which it
 would infallibly be if he visited her often). Over these phrases the
--**--**--
 and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick
 and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to
 the self-conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue, making
 him, in the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet
 glances, lest they should read what the dream within him was.
 
 He had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish that he was
 not often to visit her at the training school; but at length, his
 patience being sorely tried, he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay
 her an unexpected call.  There the news of her departure--expulsion
 as it might almost have been considered--was flashed upon him without
 warning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few
 minutes to behold her face; and when he turned away he could hardly
 see the road before him.
 
 Sue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject,
 although it was fourteen days old.  A short reflection told him that
 this proved nothing, a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for
 silence as any degree of blameworthiness.
 
 They had informed him at the school where she was living, and having
 no immediate anxiety about her comfort his thoughts took the
 direction of a burning indignation against the training school
 committee.  In his bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent
 cathedral, just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of
 the repairs.  He sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of
 the dusty imprint it made on his breeches; and his listless eyes
 following the movements of the workmen he presently became aware
 that the reputed culprit, Sue's lover Jude, was one amongst them.
 
 Jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the
--**--**--
 can't be in any other way."
 
 They moved on a dozen paces, and she showed herself recovered.  It
 was distracting to Jude, and his heart would have ached less had she
 appeared anyhow but as she did appear; essentially large-minded and
 generous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow
 womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex.
 
 "I don't blame you for what you couldn't help," she said, smiling.
 "How should I be so foolish?  I do blame you a little bit for not
 telling me before.  But, after all, it doesn't matter.  We should
 have had to keep apart, you see, even if this had not been in your
 life."
 
 "No, we shouldn't, Sue!  This is the only obstacle."
 
 "You forget that I must have loved you, and wanted to be your
 wife, even if there had been no obstacle," said Sue, with a gentle
 seriousness which did not reveal her mind.  "And then we are cousins,
 and it is bad for cousins to marry.  And--I am engaged to somebody
 else.  As to our going on together as we were going, in a sort of
 friendly way, the people round us would have made it unable to
 continue.  Their views of the relations of man and woman are limited,
 as is proved by their expelling me from the school.  Their philosophy
 only recognizes relations based on animal desire.  The wide field
 of strong attachment where desire plays, at least, only a secondary
 part, is ignored by them--the part of--who is it?--Venus Urania."
 
 Her being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of
 herself again; and before they parted she had almost regained her
 vivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her
 second-thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her
--**--**--
 He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his
 hands, looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the
 tablecloth.
 
 "Oh--nothing!"
 
 "You are 'father', you know.  That's what they call the man who gives
 you away."
 
 Jude could have said "Phillotson's age entitles him to be called
 that!"  But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.
 
 She talked incessantly, as if she dreaded his indulgence in
 reflection, and before the meal was over both he and she wished they
 had not put such confidence in their new view of things, and had
 taken breakfast apart.  What oppressed Jude was the thought that,
 having done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he was aiding and
 abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of
 imploring and warning her against it.  It was on his tongue to say,
 "You have quite made up your mind?"
 
 After breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual
 thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging
 in unceremonious companionship.  By the irony of fate, and the
 curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical
 times, she took his arm as they walked through the muddy street--a
 thing she had never done before in her life--and on turning the
 corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church
 with a low-pitched roof--the church of St. Thomas.
 
 "That's the church," said Jude.
 
 "Where I am going to be married?"
 
 "Yes."
 
 "Indeed!" she exclaimed with curiosity.  "How I should like to go in
 and see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it."
 
 Again he said to himself, "She does not realize what marriage means!"
--**--**--
 feeling for its associations.  Yet as the sun made vivid lights
 and shades of the mullioned architecture of the fa√ßades, and drew
 patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the
 quadrangles, Jude thought he had never seen the place look more
 beautiful.  He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue.
 The chair she had occupied when, leaning over her ecclesiastical
 scrolls, a hog-hair brush in her hand, her girlish figure had
 arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes, stood precisely in its
 former spot, empty.  It was as if she were dead, and nobody had been
 found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit.  Hers was
 now the city phantom, while those of the intellectual and devotional
 worthies who had once moved him to emotion were no longer able to
 assert their presence there.
 
 However, here he was; and in fulfilment of his intention he went on
 to his former lodging in "Beersheba," near the ritualistic church of
 St. Silas.  The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see
 him again, and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who
 had employed him had called to inquire his address.
 
 Jude went on to the stone-yard where he had worked.  But the old
 sheds and bankers were distasteful to him; he felt it impossible to
 engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams.
 He longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he
 might probably meet Sue.
 
 Then, for one ghastly half-hour of depression caused by these scenes,
 there returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more
 than once--that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of
 either by himself or others; and during this half-hour he met Tinker
--**--**--
 good humour.  "Just an early night-cap: I always do.  Then you can
 go out and wait a minute, as it is best we should not be seen going
 together."  She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and
 though she had evidently, from her countenance, already taken in
 enough alcohol either by drinking or, more probably, from the
 atmosphere she had breathed for so many hours, she finished hers
 quickly.  He also drank his, and went outside the house.
 
 In a few minutes she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black
 feather.  "I live quite near," she said, taking his arm, "and can let
 myself in by a latch-key at any time.  What arrangement do you want
 to come to?"
 
 "Oh--none in particular," he answered, thoroughly sick and tired, his
 thoughts again reverting to Alfredston, and the train he did not go
 by; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when
 she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and
 lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen.  "I ought to
 have gone back really!  My aunt is on her deathbed, I fear."
 
 "I'll go over with you to-morrow morning.  I think I could get a day
 off."
 
 There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,
 who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him,
 coming to the bedside of his dying aunt, and meeting Sue.  Yet he
 said, "Of course, if you'd like to, you can."
 
 "Well, that we'll consider...  Now, until we have come to some
 agreement it is awkward our being together here--where you are known,
 and I am getting known, though without any suspicion that I have
 anything to do with you.  As we are going towards the station,
--**--**--
 "There's no necessity," she quickly returned.
 
 "Oh well--perhaps not...  But I wish"
 
 "Jude--don't talk about ME--I wish you wouldn't!" she entreated.
 "It distresses me, rather.  Forgive my saying it! ...  Where did you
 stay last night?"
 
 She had asked the question in perfect innocence, to change the topic.
 He knew that, and said merely, "At an inn," though it would have been
 a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one.  But the
 latter's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered
 him lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury.
 
 Their talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston.
 That Sue was not as she had been, but was labelled "Phillotson,"
 paralyzed Jude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an
 individual.  Yet she seemed unaltered--he could not say why.
 There remained the five-mile extra journey into the country, which
 it was just as easy to walk as to drive, the greater part of it being
 uphill.  Jude had never before in his life gone that road with Sue,
 though he had with another.  It was now as if he carried a bright
 light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the
 earlier time.
 
 Sue talked; but Jude noticed that she still kept the conversation
 from herself.  At length he inquired if her husband were well.
 
 "O yes," she said.  "He is obliged to be in the school all the day,
 or he would have come with me.  He is so good and kind that to
 accompany me he would have dismissed the school for once, even
 against his principles--for he is strongly opposed to giving casual
 holidays--only I wouldn't let him.  I felt it would be better to come
 alone.  Aunt Drusilla, I knew, was so very eccentric; and his being
--**--**--
 was too sad a place to bear, while the proximity of Shaston to
 Melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a
 close engagement, such as was deliberately sought by the priests and
 virgins of the early Church, who, disdaining an ignominious flight
 from temptation, became even chamber-partners with impunity.
 Jude did not pause to remember that, in the laconic words of the
 historian, "insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights" in such
 circumstances.
 
 He now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the
 priesthood--in the recognition that the single-mindedness of his
 aims, and his fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable
 of late.  His passion for Sue troubled his soul; yet his lawful
 abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed
 instinctively a worse thing--even though she had not told him of her
 Sydney husband till afterwards.  He had, he verily believed, overcome
 all tendency to fly to liquor--which, indeed, he had never done from
 taste, but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind.  Yet
 he perceived with despondency that, taken all round, he was a man of
 too many passions to make a good clergyman; the utmost he could hope
 for was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and
 spirit the former might not always be victorious.
 
 As a hobby, auxiliary to his readings in Divinity, he developed his
 slight skill in church-music and thorough-bass, till he could join in
 part-singing from notation with some accuracy.  A mile or two from
 Melchester there was a restored village church, to which Jude had
 originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals.  By this means
 he had become acquainted with the organist, and the ultimate result
 was that he joined the choir as a bass voice.
--**--**--
 Its situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within
 living memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling
 up the winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and
 barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers
 retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.
 
 This difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd
 facts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a
 roof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed
 through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave
 rise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations
 to man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere.  It was a place
 where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where
 beer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton
 women than honest wives and maids.  It is also said that after the
 Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests,
 and hence were compelled to pull down their churches, and refrain
 altogether from the public worship of God; a necessity which they
 bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday
 afternoons.  In those days the Shastonians were apparently not
 without a sense of humour.
 
 There was another peculiarity--this a modern one--which Shaston
 appeared to owe to its site.  It was the resting-place and
 headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows,
 shooting-galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business
 lay largely at fairs and markets.  As strange wild birds are seen
 assembled on some lofty promontory, meditatively pausing for longer
 flights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here,
 in this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green
--**--**--
 "That will be very nice.  Shall I come and see you there?  It is in
 this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an
 hour?"
 
 "No. Don't come!"
 
 "What--aren't we going to be friends, then, any longer, as we used to
 be?"
 
 "No."
 
 "I didn't know that.  I thought you were always going to be kind to
 me!"
 
 "No, I am not."
 
 "What have I done, then?  I am sure I thought we two--"  The
 _tremolo_ in her voice caused her to break off.
 
 "Sue, I sometimes think you are a flirt," said he abruptly.
 
 There was a momentary pause, till she suddenly jumped up; and to his
 surprise he saw by the kettle-flame that her face was flushed.
 
 "I can't talk to you any longer, Jude!" she said, the tragic
 contralto note having come back as of old.  "It is getting too dark
 to stay together like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes
 that make one feel what one shouldn't! ...  We mustn't sit and talk
 in this way any more.  Yes--you must go away, for you mistake me!  I
 am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly--Oh, Jude, it WAS
 cruel to say that!  Yet I can't tell you the truth--I should shock
 you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and how much I
 feel that I shouldn't have been provided with attractiveness unless
 it were meant to be exercised!  Some women's love of being loved is
 insatiable; and so, often, is their love of loving; and in the last
 case they may find that they can't give it continuously to the
 chamber-officer appointed by the bishop's licence to receive it.
 But you are so straightforward, Jude, that you can't understand
 me! ...  Now you must go. I am sorry my husband is not at home."
--**--**--
 had once given her his; but she had others, he knew.  Yet it was his,
 surely?
 
 He knew he should go to see her again, according to her invitation.
 Those earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle
 irreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters
 if they doubted their own strength.  But he could not.  He might fast
 and pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful
 in him than the Divine.

 However, if God disposed not, woman did.  The next morning but one
 brought him this note from her:
 
 
    Don't come next week.  On your own account don't!  We were
    too free, under the influence of that morbid hymn and the
    twilight.  Think no more than you can help of
 
    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY.
 
 
 The disappointment was keen.  He knew her mood, the look of her face,
 when she subscribed herself at length thus.  But whatever her mood he
 could not say she was wrong in her view. He replied:
 
 
    I acquiesce.  You are right.  It is a lesson in
    renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this
    season.
 
    JUDE.
 
 
 He despatched the note on Easter Eve, and there seemed a finality
 in their decisions.  But other forces and laws than theirs were in
 operation.  On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the
 Widow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious
 happened:
 
 
    Your aunt is sinking.  Come at once.
 
 
 He threw down his tools and went.  Three and a half hours later he
 was crossing the downs about Marygreen, and presently plunged into
 the concave field across which the short cut was made to the village.
 As he ascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been
 watching his approach from a gate across the path, moved uneasily,
--**--**--
 "Oh--of course, if you think it necessary.  But as it means nothing
 it may be bothering him needlessly."
 
 "Well--are you sure you mean it only as my cousin?"
 
 "Absolutely sure.  I have no feelings of love left in me."
 
 "That's news.  How has it come to be?"
 
 "I've seen Arabella."
 
 She winced at the hit; then said curiously, "When did you see her?"
 
 "When I was at Christminster."
 
 "So she's come back; and you never told me!  I suppose you will live
 with her now?"
 
 "Of course--just as you live with your husband."
 
 She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,
 withered for want of attention, and through them at the outer
 distance, till her eyes began to grow moist.  "What is it?" said
 Jude, in a softened tone.
 
 "Why should you be so glad to go back to her if--if what you used to
 say to me is still true--I mean if it were true then!  Of course it
 is not now!  How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?"
 
 "A special Providence, I suppose, helped it on its way."
 
 "Ah--it isn't true!" she said with gentle resentment.  "You are
 teasing me--that's all--because you think I am not happy!"
 
 "I don't know.  I don't wish to know."
 
 "If I were unhappy it would be my fault, my wickedness; not that
 I should have a right to dislike him!  He is considerate to me in
 everything; and he is very interesting, from the amount of general
 knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his
 way....  Do you think, Jude, that a man ought to marry a woman his
 own age, or one younger than himself--eighteen years--as I am than
 he?"
 
 "It depends upon what they feel for each other."
 
 He gave her no opportunity of self-satisfaction, and she had to go on
--**--**--
 
 In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and laid her face upon
 his hair, weeping, and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little
 kiss upon the top of his head, withdrawing quickly, so that he could
 not put his arms round her, as otherwise he unquestionably would have
 done.  She shut the casement, and he returned to his cottage.
 
 
 
 III
 
 
 Sue's distressful confession recurred to Jude's mind all the night as
 being a sorrow indeed.
 
 The morning after, when it was time for her to go, the neighbours saw
 her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path
 which led into the lonely road to Alfredston.  An hour passed before
 he returned along the same route, and in his face there was a look of
 exaltation not unmixed with recklessness.  An incident had occurred.
 
 They had stood parting in the silent highway, and their tense and
 passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how
 far their intimacy ought to go; till they had almost quarrelled, and
 she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in
 embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he
 now wished to do.  Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss
 would be nothing: all would depend upon the spirit of it.  If given
 in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection: if in
 the spirit of a lover she could not permit it.  "Will you swear that
 it will not be in that spirit?" she had said.
 
 No: he would not.  And then they had turned from each other in
 estrangement, and gone their several ways, till at a distance
 of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously.
--**--**--
 temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial
 relation with Phillotson, possibly with scarce any man, walked
 fitfully along, and panted, and brought weariness into her eyes by
 gazing and worrying hopelessly.
 
 Phillotson met her at the arrival station, and, seeing that she was
 troubled, thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her
 aunt's death and funeral.  He began telling her of his day's doings,
 and how his friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he
 had not seen for years, had called upon him.  While ascending to the
 town, seated on the top of the omnibus beside him, she said suddenly
 and with an air of self-chastisement, regarding the white road and
 its bordering bushes of hazel:
 
 "Richard--I let Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while.  I don't know
 whether you think it wrong?"
 
 He, waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould, said
 vaguely, "Oh, did you?  What did you do that for?"
 
 "I don't know.  He wanted to, and I let him."
 
 "I hope it pleased him.  I should think it was hardly a novelty."
 
 They lapsed into silence.  Had this been a case in the court of an
 omniscient judge, he might have entered on his notes the curious fact
 that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not
 said a word about the kiss.
 
 After tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers.
 She remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,
 and at last, saying she was tired, went to bed early.  When
 Phillotson arrived upstairs, weary with the drudgery of the
 attendance-numbers, it was a quarter to twelve o'clock.  Entering
 their chamber, which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty
 miles over the Vale of Blackmoor, and even into Outer Wessex, he went
--**--**--
 "No--I don't know!  The universe, I suppose--things in general,
 because they are so horrid and cruel!"
 
 "Well, it is no use talking like that.  Making a man's house so
 unseemly at this time o' night!  Eliza will hear if we don't mind."
 (He meant the servant.)  "Just think if either of the parsons in this
 town was to see us now!  I hate such eccentricities, Sue.  There's no
 order or regularity in your sentiments! ...  But I won't intrude on
 you further; only I would advise you not to shut the door too tight,
 or I shall find you stifled to-morrow."
 
 On rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet, but
 Sue had already gone downstairs.  There was a little nest where she
 had lain, and spiders' webs hung overhead.  "What must a woman's
 aversion be when it is stronger than her fear of spiders!" he said
 bitterly.
 
 He found her sitting at the breakfast-table, and the meal began
 almost in silence, the burghers walking past upon the pavement--or
 rather roadway, pavements being scarce here--which was two or three
 feet above the level of the parlour floor.  They nodded down to the
 happy couple their morning greetings, as they went on.
 
 "Richard," she said all at once; "would you mind my living away from
 you?"
 
 "Away from me?  Why, that's what you were doing when I married you.
 What then was the meaning of marrying at all?"
 
 "You wouldn't like me any the better for telling you."
 
 "I don't object to know."
 
 "Because I thought I could do nothing else.  You had got my promise a
 long time before that, remember.  Then, as time went on, I regretted
 I had promised you, and was trying to see an honourable way to break
 it off.  But as I couldn't I became rather reckless and careless
--**--**--
 temperaments, which should be classified.  If people are at all
 peculiar in character they have to suffer from the very rules that
 produce comfort in others! ...  Will you let me?"
 
 "But we married--"
 
 "What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances," she burst out,
 "if they make you miserable when you know you are committing no sin?"
 
 "But you are committing a sin in not liking me."
 
 "I DO like you!  But I didn't reflect it would be--that it would be
 so much more than that...  For a man and woman to live on intimate
 terms when one feels as I do is adultery, in any circumstances,
 however legal.  There--I've said it! ...  Will you let me, Richard?"
 
 "You distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!"
 
 "Why can't we agree to free each other?  We made the compact, and
 surely we can cancel it--not legally of course; but we can morally,
 especially as no new interests, in the shape of children, have arisen
 to be looked after.  Then we might be friends, and meet without pain
 to either.  Oh Richard, be my friend and have pity!  We shall both be
 dead in a few years, and then what will it matter to anybody that you
 relieved me from constraint for a little while?  I daresay you think
 me eccentric, or super-sensitive, or something absurd.  Well--why
 should I suffer for what I was born to be, if it doesn't hurt other
 people?"
 
 "But it does--it hurts ME!  And you vowed to love me."
 
 "Yes--that's it!  I am in the wrong.  I always am!  It is as culpable
 to bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always, and as
 silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink!"
 
 "And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?"
--**--**--
 
 
    Where Stour receives her strength,
    From six cleere fountains fed, [Drayton.]
 
 
 when he crossed a tributary of the Stour, and reached Leddenton--a
 little town of three or four thousand inhabitants--where he went
 on to the boys' school, and knocked at the door of the master's
 residence.
 
 A boy pupil-teacher opened it, and to Phillotson's inquiry if Mr.
 Gillingham was at home replied that he was, going at once off to his
 own house, and leaving Phillotson to find his way in as he could.  He
 discovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been
 giving evening lessons.  The light of the paraffin lamp fell on
 Phillotson's face--pale and wretched by contrast with his friend's,
 who had a cool, practical look.  They had been schoolmates in
 boyhood, and fellow-students at Wintoncester Training College, many
 years before this time.
 
 "Glad to see you, Dick!  But you don't look well?  Nothing the
 matter?"
 
 Phillotson advanced without replying, and Gillingham closed the
 cupboard and pulled up beside his visitor.
 
 "Why you haven't been here--let me see--since you were married?
 I called, you know, but you were out; and upon my word it is such a
 climb after dark that I have been waiting till the days are longer
 before lumpering up again.  I am glad you didn't wait, however."
 
 Though well-trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally
 used a dialect-word of their boyhood to each other in private.
 
 "I've come, George, to explain to you my reasons for taking a step
 that I am about to take, so that you, at least, will understand my
 motives if other people question them anywhen--as they may, indeed
 certainly will...  But anything is better than the present condition
 of things.  God forbid that you should ever have such an experience
 as mine!"
 
 "Sit down.  You don't mean--anything wrong between you and Mrs.
--**--**--
 plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a
 moment.  You said when I called that she was puzzling and peculiar:
 I think you are!"
 
 "Have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically
 a good woman, while she has pleaded for release--been the man she has
 knelt to and implored indulgence of?"
 
 "I am thankful to say I haven't."
 
 "Then I don't think you are in a position to give an opinion.  I
 have been that man, and it makes all the difference in the world, if
 one has any manliness or chivalry in him.  I had not the remotest
 idea--living apart from women as I have done for so many years--that
 merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger
 could by any possibility involve one in such a daily, continuous
 tragedy as that now shared by her and me!"
 
 "Well, I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you, provided
 she kept to herself.  But to go attended by a cavalier--that makes a
 difference."
 
 "Not a bit.  Suppose, as I believe, she would rather endure her
 present misery than be made to promise to keep apart from him?
 All that is a question for herself.  It is not the same thing at
 all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him
 false...  However, she has not distinctly implied living with him
 as wife, though I think she means to...  And to the best of my
 understanding it is not an ignoble, merely animal, feeling between
 the two: that is the worst of it; because it makes me think their
 affection will be enduring.  I did not mean to confess to you that in
 the first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right
--**--**--
 
 Gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way, and at parting
 expressed his hope that this consultation, singular as its subject
 was, would be the renewal of their old comradeship.  "Stick to her!"
 were his last words, flung into the darkness after Phillotson; from
 which his friend answered "Aye, aye!"
 
 But when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and no
 sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour,
 he said, "So Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments
 against it than those!"
 
 "I think she ought to be smacked, and brought to her senses--that's
 what I think!" murmured Gillingham, as he walked back alone.
 
 The next morning came, and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue:
 
 "You may go--with whom you will.  I absolutely and unconditionally
 agree."
 
 Having once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more
 and more indubitably the true one.  His mild serenity at the sense
 that he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost
 overpowered his grief at relinquishing her.
 
 Some days passed, and the evening of their last meal together had
 come--a cloudy evening with wind--which indeed was very seldom absent
 in this elevated place.  How permanently it was imprinted upon his
 vision; that look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea;
 a slim flexible figure; a face, strained from its roundness, and
 marked by the pallors of restless days and nights, suggesting tragic
 possibilities quite at variance with her times of buoyancy; a trying
 of this morsel and that, and an inability to eat either.  Her nervous
 manner, begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course,
 might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that
 Phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes
--**--**--
 You are free, absolutely; and your course is your own."
 
 "Very well.  But I'll just say that I have packed only a change or
 two of my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides
 that are my very own.  I wish you would look into my trunk before it
 is closed.  Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into
 Jude's portmanteau."
 
 "Of course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage!  I wish
 you would take three-quarters of the household furniture.  I don't
 want to be bothered with it.  I have a sort of affection for a little
 of it that belonged to my poor mother and father.  But the rest you
 are welcome to whenever you like to send for it."
 
 "That I shall never do."
 
 "You go by the six-thirty train, don't you?  It is now a quarter to
 six."
 
 "You...  You don't seem very sorry I am going, Richard!"
 
 "Oh no--perhaps not."
 
 "I like you much for how you have behaved.  It is a curious thing
 that directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but as
 my old teacher, I like you.  I won't be so affected as to say I love
 you, because you know I don't, except as a friend.  But you do seem
 that to me!"
 
 Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and
 then the station omnibus came round to take her up.  Phillotson saw
 her things put on the top, handed her in, and was obliged to make an
 appearance of kissing her as he wished her good-bye, which she quite
 understood and imitated.  From the cheerful manner in which they
 parted the omnibus-man had no other idea than that she was going for
--**--**--
 
 "That I NEVER would have done."
 
 Jude's eyes rested musingly on her face.  Then he suddenly kissed
 her; and was going to kiss her again.  "No--only once now--please,
 Jude!"
 
 "That's rather cruel," he answered; but acquiesced.  "Such a strange
 thing has happened to me," Jude continued after a silence.  "Arabella
 has actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her--in kindness
 to her, she says.  She wants to honestly and legally marry that man
 she has already married virtually; and begs me to enable her to do
 it."
 
 "What have you done?"
 
 "I have agreed.  I thought at first I couldn't do it without getting
 her into trouble about that second marriage, and I don't want to
 injure her in any way.  Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all!
 But nobody knows about it over here, and I find it will not be a
 difficult proceeding at all.  If she wants to start afresh I have
 only too obvious reasons for not hindering her."
 
 "Then you'll be free?"
 
 "Yes, I shall be free."
 
 "Where are we booked for?" she asked, with the discontinuity that
 marked her to-night.
 
 "Aldbrickham, as I said."
 
 "But it will be very late when we get there?"
 
 "Yes.  I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the
 Temperance Hotel there."
 
 "One?"
 
 "Yes--one."
 
 She looked at him.  "Oh Jude!"  Sue bent her forehead against the
 corner of the compartment.  "I thought you might do it; and that I
 was deceiving you.  But I didn't mean that!"
 
 In the pause which followed, Jude's eyes fixed themselves with
 a stultified expression on the opposite seat.  "Well!" he
 said...  "Well!"
 
 He remained in silence; and seeing how discomfited he was she put her
 face against his cheek, murmuring, "Don't be vexed, dear!"
--**--**--
 lady, at any rate, that wasn't you by no manner of means--jest as med
 be with you now."
 
 "Oh do you?" said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart.  "Though I
 think you must be mistaken!  How long ago was it?"
 
 "About a month or two.  A handsome, full-figured woman.  They had
 this room."
 
 When Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and
 miserable.  "Jude," she said to him plaintively, at their parting
 that night upon the landing, "it is not so nice and pleasant as it
 used to be with us!  I don't like it here--I can't bear the place!
 And I don't like you so well as I did!"
 
 "How fidgeted you seem, dear!  Why do you change like this?"
 
 "Because it was cruel to bring me here!"
 
 "Why?"
 
 "You were lately here with Arabella.  There, now I have said it!"
 
 "Dear me, why--" said Jude looking round him.  "Yes--it is the same!
 I really didn't know it, Sue.  Well--it is not cruel, since we have
 come as we have--two relations staying together."
 
 "How long ago was it you were here?  Tell me, tell me!"
 
 "The day before I met you in Christminster, when we went back to
 Marygreen together.  I told you I had met her."
 
 "Yes, you said you had met her, but you didn't tell me all.  Your
 story was that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband
 and wife at all in Heaven's sight--not that you had made it up with
 her."
 
 "We didn't make it up," he said sadly.  "I can't explain, Sue."
 
 "You've been false to me; you, my last hope!  And I shall never
 forget it, never!"
 
 "But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only to be friends, not
 lovers!  It is so very inconsistent of you to--"
--**--**--
 "She doesn't care anything about me!" said Phillotson.  "Why should
 she?"
 
 "She doesn't know you are ill."
 
 "So much the better for both of us."
 
 "Where are her lover and she living?"
 
 "At Melchester--I suppose; at least he was living there some time
 ago."
 
 When Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected, and at last wrote
 an anonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her,
 the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the
 diocesan capital.  Arriving at that place it was forwarded to
 Marygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only
 person who knew his present address--the widow who had nursed his
 aunt.
 
 Three days later, in the evening, when the sun was going down in
 splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and making the Shaston
 windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale,
 the sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house, and a
 few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door.  Phillotson
 did not speak; the door was hesitatingly opened, and there
 entered--Sue.
 
 She was in light spring clothing, and her advent seemed ghostly--like
 the flitting in of a moth.  He turned his eyes upon her, and flushed;
 but appeared to check his primary impulse to speak.
 
 "I have no business here," she said, bending her frightened face to
 him.  "But I heard you were ill--very ill; and--and as I know that
 you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical
 love, I have come."
 
 "I am not very ill, my dear friend.  Only unwell."
 
 "I didn't know that; and I am afraid that only a severe illness would
 have justified my coming!"
 
 "Yes... yes.  And I almost wish you had not come!  It is a little
--**--**--
 Shaston two or three times a week, although, there and back, it was
 a journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and
 supper, after a hard day's work in school.  When he called on the
 next occasion after Sue's visit his friend was downstairs, and
 Gillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a
 more fixed and composed one.
 
 "She's been here since you called last," said Phillotson.
 
 "Not Mrs. Phillotson?"
 
 "Yes."
 
 "Ah!  You have made it up?"
 
 "No...  She just came, patted my pillow with her little white hand,
 played the thoughtful nurse for half an hour, and went away."
 
 "Well--I'm hanged!  A little hussy!"
 
 "What do you say?"
 
 "Oh--nothing!"
 
 "What do you mean?"
 
 "I mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman!  If she were
 not your wife--"
 
 "She is not; she's another man's except in name and law.  And I have
 been thinking--it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with
 her--that, in kindness to her, I ought to dissolve the legal tie
 altogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she has
 been back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven
 her.  I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it,
 though I did not see it at the moment.  What's the use of keeping
 her chained on to me if she doesn't belong to me?  I know--I feel
 absolutely certain--that she would welcome my taking such a step as
 the greatest charity to her.  For though as a fellow-creature she
 sympathizes with, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband
 she cannot endure me--she loathes me--there's no use in mincing
 words--she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful
 course is to complete what I have begun...  And for worldly reasons,
--**--**--
 (as he called himself on his front door) was to employ for the
 simple memorials they required for their dead.  But he seemed more
 independent than before, and it was the only arrangement under which
 Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him, could render any
 assistance.

 It was an evening at the end of the month, and Jude had just returned
 home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not
 far off.  When he entered, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during
 his absence, laid out supper for him.  Contrary to custom she did not
 speak.  Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused
 till, raising his eyes, he saw that her face was troubled.
 
 "Are you depressed, Sue?" he said.
 
 She paused a moment.  "I have a message for you," she answered.
 
 "Somebody has called?"
 
 "Yes.  A woman."  Sue's voice quavered as she spoke, and she suddenly
 sat down from her preparations, laid her hands in her lap, and looked
 into the fire.  "I don't know whether I did right or not!" she
 continued.  "I said you were not at home, and when she said she would
 wait, I said I thought you might not be able to see her."
 
 "Why did you say that, dear?  I suppose she wanted a headstone.  Was
 she in mourning?"
 
 "No. She wasn't in mourning, and she didn't want a headstone; and I
 thought you couldn't see her."  Sue looked critically and imploringly
 at him.
 
 "But who was she?  Didn't she say?"
 
 "No. She wouldn't give her name.  But I know who she was--I think I
 do!  It was Arabella!"
 
 "Heaven save us!  What should Arabella come for?  What made you think
 it was she?"
 
 "Oh, I can hardly tell.  But I know it was!  I feel perfectly certain
--**--**--
 They listened, and the knocking came again.  No servant was kept in
 the house, and if the summons were to be responded to one of them
 would have to do it in person.  "I'll open a window," said Jude.
 "Whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time."
 
 He accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash.  The lonely
 street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of
 one figure--that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few
 yards off.
 
 "Who's there?" he asked.
 
 "Is that Mr. Fawley?" came up from the woman, in a voice which was
 unmistakably Arabella's.
 
 Jude replied that it was.
 
 "Is it she?" asked Sue from the door, with lips apart.
 
 "Yes, dear," said Jude.  "What do you want, Arabella?" he inquired.
 
 "I beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you," said Arabella humbly.
 "But I called earlier--I wanted particularly to see you to-night, if
 I could.  I am in trouble, and have nobody to help me!"
 
 "In trouble, are you?"
 
 "Yes."
 
 There was a silence.  An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in
 Jude's breast at the appeal.  "But aren't you married?" he said.
 
 Arabella hesitated.  "No, Jude, I am not," she returned.  "He
 wouldn't, after all.  And I am in great difficulty.  I hope to get
 another situation as barmaid soon.  But it takes time, and I really
 am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that's been
 sprung upon me from Australia; or I wouldn't trouble you--believe me
 I wouldn't. I want to tell you about it."
 
 Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension, hearing every word, but
 speaking none.
 
 "You are not really in want of money, Arabella?" he asked, in a
 distinctly softened tone.
 
 "I have enough to pay for the night's lodging I have obtained, but
--**--**--
 and Sue was wicked enough, despite her penitence, to wish for a
 moment that Jude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight
 full upon her.  She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under
 the lamps, but a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight
 of her own fresh charms in the looking-glass made Sue's manner
 bright, till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in
 her, and hated herself for it.
 
 "I've just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night,
 that's all," she said gently.  "I was afraid afterwards that you
 might have met with any mishap?"
 
 "Oh--how stupid this is!  I thought my visitor was--your friend--your
 husband--Mrs. Fawley, as I suppose you call yourself?" said Arabella,
 flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and
 ceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to
 produce.
 
 "Indeed I don't," said Sue.
 
 "Oh, I thought you might have, even if he's not really yours.
 Decency is decency, any hour of the twenty-four."
 
 "I don't know what you mean," said Sue stiffly.  "He is mine, if you
 come to that!"
 
 "He wasn't yesterday."
 
 Sue coloured roseate, and said, "How do you know?"
 
 "From your manner when you talked to me at the door.  Well, my dear,
 you've been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped
 it on--ha-ha!  But I don't want to get him away from you."
 
 Sue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet-cover, and at the
 detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking-glass, just
 as it had done in Jude's time; and wished she had not come.  In the
 pause there was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a
 telegram for "Mrs. Cartlett."
--**--**--
 business, as I told him.  I came about that more than anything else.
 Would he run up to speak to me at the station as I am going?  You
 think not.  Well, I'll write to him about it.  I didn't want to write
 it, but never mind--I will."
 
 
 
 III
 
 
 When Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the
 initial step towards their marriage.  She clasped his arm, and they
 went along silently together, as true comrades oft-times do.  He saw
 that she was preoccupied, and forbore to question her.
 
 "Oh Jude--I've been talking to her," she said at last.  "I wish I
 hadn't!  And yet it is best to be reminded of things."
 
 "I hope she was civil."
 
 "Yes.  I--I can't help liking her--just a little bit!  She's not
 an ungenerous nature; and I am so glad her difficulties have all
 suddenly ended."  She explained how Arabella had been summoned back,
 and would be enabled to retrieve her position.  "I was referring
 to our old question.  What Arabella has been saying to me has made
 me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal
 marriage is--a sort of trap to catch a man--I can't bear to think
 of it.  I wish I hadn't promised to let you put up the banns this
 morning!"
 
 "Oh, don't mind me.  Any time will do for me.  I thought you might
 like to get it over quickly, now."
 
 "Indeed, I don't feel any more anxious now than I did before.
 Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but among the
 very few virtues possessed by your family and mine, dear, I think I
 may set staunchness.  So I am not a bit frightened about losing you,
 now I really am yours and you really are mine.  In fact, I am easier
--**--**--
    convenient to write about the birth.  I was then looking
    out for a good situation, so my parents took the child,
    and he has been with them ever since.  That was why I did
    not mention it when I met you in Christminster, nor at
    the law proceedings.  He is now of an intelligent age, of
    course, and my mother and father have lately written to
    say that, as they have rather a hard struggle over there,
    and I am settled comfortably here, they don't see why
    they should be encumbered with the child any longer, his
    parents being alive.  I would have him with me here in
    a moment, but he is not old enough to be of any use in
    the bar nor will be for years and years, and naturally
    Cartlett might think him in the way.  They have, however,
    packed him off to me in charge of some friends who
    happened to be coming home, and I must ask you to take
    him when he arrives, for I don't know what to do with him.
    He is lawfully yours, that I solemnly swear.  If anybody
    says he isn't, call them brimstone liars, for my sake.
    Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was
    honest to you from the time we were married till I went
    away, and I remain, yours, &c.,
 
    ARABELLA CARTLETT.
 
 
 Sue's look was one of dismay.  "What will you do, dear?" she asked
 faintly.
 
 Jude did not reply, and Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy
 breaths.
 
 "It hits me hard!" said he in an under-voice. "It MAY be true!
 I can't make it out.  Certainly, if his birth was exactly when
 she says, he's mine.  I cannot think why she didn't tell me when
 I met her at Christminster, and came on here that evening with
--**--**--
 inquiring gaze at anything.  It could have been seen that the boy's
 ideas of life were different from those of the local boys.  Children
 begin with detail, and learn up to the general; they begin with the
 contiguous, and gradually comprehend the universal.  The boy seemed
 to have begun with the generals of life, and never to have concerned
 himself with the particulars.  To him the houses, the willows,
 the obscure fields beyond, were apparently regarded not as brick
 residences, pollards, meadows; but as human dwellings in the
 abstract, vegetation, and the wide dark world.
 
 He found the way to the little lane, and knocked at the door of
 Jude's house.  Jude had just retired to bed, and Sue was about to
 enter her chamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down.
 
 "Is this where Father lives?" asked the child.
 
 "Who?"
 
 "Mr. Fawley, that's his name."
 
 Sue ran up to Jude's room and told him, and he hurried down as soon
 as he could, though to her impatience he seemed long.
 
 "What--is it he--so soon?" she asked as Jude came.
 
 She scrutinized the child's features, and suddenly went away into the
 little sitting-room adjoining.  Jude lifted the boy to a level with
 himself, keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness, and telling him
 he would have been met if they had known of his coming so soon, set
 him provisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for Sue, whose
 supersensitiveness was disturbed, as he knew.  He found her in the
 dark, bending over an arm-chair.  He enclosed her with his arm, and
 putting his face by hers, whispered, "What's the matter?"
 
 "What Arabella says is true--true!  I see you in him!"
 
 "Well: that's one thing in my life as it should be, at any rate."
 
 "But the other half of him is--SHE!  And that's what I can't bear!
