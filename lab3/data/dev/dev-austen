--**--**--
 needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearance
 it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus
 bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous exhibition in
 the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment to
 admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving,
 and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first
 five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.
 
 Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be
 always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to
 see, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be some
 ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his
 father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he
 inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he was
 not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity. A few minutes were
 enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir
 Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of
 calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the
 happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to the
 drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was
 not lost on all.
 
 "I come from your theatre," said he composedly, as he sat down; "I found
 myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room--but in
 every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest
 suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. It
 appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight,
--**--**--
 at the speaker.
 
 "If I must say what I think," continued Mr. Rushworth, "in my opinion it
 is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a
 good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are
 a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,
 and doing nothing."
 
 Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, "I am
 happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives
 me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted,
 and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly
 natural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a
 home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at
 your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance
 for yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of
 the importance of having an ally of such weight."
 
 Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion in better words
 than he could find himself. He was aware that he must not expect a
 genius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with
 better notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to
 value him very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to
 smile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but by
 looking, as he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's
 good opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards
 preserving that good opinion a little longer.
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XX
 
 Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and
 give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own
--**--**--
 have been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have
 disapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the
 plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;
 but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of unsteady
 characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard her
 acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafe
 amusements, than that such measures and such amusements should have
 been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly
 being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was ashamed to
 confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring
 to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her influence was
 insufficient--that she might have talked in vain. Her only resource was
 to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn the current
 of Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel. She had a great deal to
 insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to the interest
 and comfort of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance
 at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own
 fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady
 Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most considerable saving had
 always arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But her
 chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest support and glory was
 in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths. _There_ she
 was impregnable. She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr.
 Rushworth's admiration of Maria to any effect. "If I had not been
 active," said she, "and made a point of being introduced to his mother,
 and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certain
--**--**--
 Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,
 though as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his friend
 had been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom had taken
 the opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his father's
 particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as
 might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the same way was
 an instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation was such,
 that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his friend's
 youngest sister, he believed he should certainly attack the baronet
 on the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a little more
 rationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in Mansfield
 Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas,
 when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it
 wiser to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it without
 opposition. He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and often
 been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never, in
 the whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so
 unintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was
 not a man to be endured but for his children's sake, and he might be
 thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay
 a few days longer under his roof.
 
 The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every
 mind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his
 daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a
 good deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that
--**--**--
 Thomas's wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so very
 natural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little while, I
 dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing
 for the difference of the time of year."
 
 "This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her
 infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and November
 is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very
 anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on."
 
 Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, and
 leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--her accomplishments, her
 spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into
 any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion of
 herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she began to talk
 of something else.
 
 "To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.
 Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle
 may continue to like Mr. Rushworth."
 
 "That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow's
 visit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread
 the stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to
 follow--the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much
 longer deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give
 something that Rushworth and Maria had never met."
 
 In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.
 Not all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth's
 deference for him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part of
 the truth--that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant
--**--**--
 obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and
 waited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning
 downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the rain
 continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus
 extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the period
 of dressing and dinner.
 
 The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might
 have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way,
 and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at
 the end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant's
 carriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened.
 As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might
 occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her
 being out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that
 none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse
 to establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be
 indubitable to aunt Bertram.
 
 It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the
 room, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgment
 of her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which could
 hardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its being
 in Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural
 circumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the
 instrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but Miss
 Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was
--**--**--
 place of this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and between
 ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson
 ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind."
 
 "I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!" said Fanny, in reply. "My
 uncle's gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and
 so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.
 The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!
 When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some
 countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that
 does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should
 nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence.
 You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially
 when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of
 wondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest natural
 production without finding food for a rambling fancy."
 
 "To say the truth," replied Miss Crawford, "I am something like the
 famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no
 wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had
 told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be
 spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should
 not have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,
 moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed."
 
 "_Too_ quiet for you, I believe."
 
 "I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but," and her eyes
 brightened as she spoke, "take it all and all, I never spent so happy a
--**--**--
 Robert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse, cook
 has just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished
 not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grant
 would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep
 beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me think
 the weather most unseasonably close."
 
 "The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!" said Miss Crawford
 archly. "Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer."
 
 "My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.
 Paul's, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you
 could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have
 me do?"
 
 "Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,
 and never lose your temper."
 
 "Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live
 where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I
 dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and
 the poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and
 unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing
 forth bitter lamentations."
 
 "I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort.
 A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It
 certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it."
 
 "You intend to be very rich?" said Edmund, with a look which, to Fanny's
 eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.
 
 "To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?"
 
 "I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power
--**--**--
 meant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended
 to your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to
 _us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come
 into her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia
 had been at home, you would not have been asked at all."
 
 Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant's part of
 the favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only
 say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,
 and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening work in such a
 state as to prevent her being missed.
 
 "Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you
 would not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easy
 about your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, and
 find it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is the
 very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I
 cannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant should
 not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too,
 which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to
 take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would
 have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which is
 wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better
 it would have been! and how much more he would have been respected! for
 people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere.
 Remember that, Fanny. Five--only five to be sitting round that table.
--**--**--
 
 But this could not impose on Fanny. She felt that the carriage was for
 herself, and herself alone: and her uncle's consideration of her, coming
 immediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her some
 tears of gratitude when she was alone.
 
 The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the
 gentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being
 late, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them
 off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.
 
 "Now I must look at you, Fanny," said Edmund, with the kind smile of an
 affectionate brother, "and tell you how I like you; and as well as I can
 judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?"
 
 "The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin's
 marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as
 soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all
 the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine."
 
 "A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no
 finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems
 very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown
 something the same?"
 
 In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and
 coach-house.
 
 "Heyday!" said Edmund, "here's company, here's a carriage! who have they
 got to meet us?" And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, "'Tis
 Crawford's, Crawford's barouche, I protest! There are his own two men
 pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This is
 quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him."
--**--**--
 "Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.
 Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly well
 off for a cadet of even a baronet's family. By the time he is four or
 five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for
 it."
 
 Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do
 and to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of; but she
 checked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned
 when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.
 
 "Bertram," said Henry Crawford, "I shall make a point of coming to
 Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose
 to encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not
 you join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend
 with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--as I shall do--not
 to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence
 preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a
 pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that
 Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you."
 
 "I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can," said Edmund;
 "for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more
 sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man."
 
 "Will he not feel this?" thought Fanny. "No, he can feel nothing as he
 ought."
 
 The party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each
 other, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed
 after tea--formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his
--**--**--
 
 Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or
 unlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her in the last few
 months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,
 as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and
 friend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes
 and fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,
 dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give
 her direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers and
 sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all the
 comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready to
 think of every member of that home as she directed, or differing only
 by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris,
 and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil
 and good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and every
 former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.
 An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal
 tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the same
 blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of
 enjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; and
 it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which
 no subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains of the
 earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is
 so. Fraternal love, sometimes almost everything, is at others worse than
 nothing. But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment
 in all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition of interest,
 cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling the influence of time and
--**--**--
 out the blacksmith's shop. The house must be turned to front the east
 instead of the north--the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be
 on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be
 done. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the
 garden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house;
 which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to the
 south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yards
 up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look about
 me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows
 beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_, sweeping
 round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the
 principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of
 course; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They
 belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Then
 the stream--something must be done with the stream; but I could not
 quite determine what. I had two or three ideas."
 
 "And I have two or three ideas also," said Edmund, "and one of them is,
 that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in
 practice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I
 think the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air
 of a gentleman's residence, without any very heavy expense, and that
 must suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me."
 
 Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of
 voice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his
--**--**--
 occasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering
 Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and
 suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character
 and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself by a single
 attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.
 
 All the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour. It was
 time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she was glad to
 find it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her
 spirits by a change of place and neighbour.
 
 The chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the
 fire, and waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most
 detached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,
 talking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of the
 rest began to think of them. Henry Crawford's chair was the first to be
 given a direction towards them, and he sat silently observing them for a
 few minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas, who was
 standing in chat with Dr. Grant.
 
 "This is the assembly night," said William. "If I were at Portsmouth I
 should be at it, perhaps."
 
 "But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?"
 
 "No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of
 dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would
 be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.
 The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a
 commission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_
 nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing
 fine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted
--**--**--
 herself.
 
 Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl
 which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round
 her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she was
 obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention.
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXVI
 
 William's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary
 impression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas
 had then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remained
 steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody
 else who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the
 young people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken
 his resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the
 next morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what
 his nephew had said, he added, "I do not like, William, that you
 should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me
 pleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton.
 Your cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would not
 altogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. I
 believe we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would
 be more eligible; and if--"
 
 "Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!" interrupted Mrs. Norris, "I knew what was
 coming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home,
 or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion
 for such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance
 at Mansfield. I know you would. If _they_ were at home to grace the
 ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,
--**--**--
 behind; and that though she felt she must go, and knew she should enjoy
 herself when once away, she was already looking forward to being at
 Mansfield again. Was there not a "yes" in all this?
 
 With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund
 could not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the
 rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of
 strong interest. Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it, the
 evening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting
 of the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of
 receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but the
 whirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the
 excitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for
 the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which
 he felt in his power, and the only preparation for the ball which he
 could enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him on the
 subject, from morning till night.
 
 Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still
 unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to
 seek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and
 her sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless;
 and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reason
 to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonage
 without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion;
 and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to
 Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.
 
 She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting
--**--**--
 Miss Crawford's eyes which she could not be satisfied with.
 
 It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's change of
 manners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he was
 gallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to her
 cousins: he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity as
 he had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in this
 necklace--she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss Crawford,
 complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.
 
 Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she had
 so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she now walked
 home again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her
 treading that path before.
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXVII
 
 On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this
 unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some
 favourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures;
 but on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund
 there writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred before,
 was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.
 
 "Fanny," said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting her
 with something in his hand, "I beg your pardon for being here. I came
 to look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming
 in, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will find
 the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business,
 which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain
 for William's cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has
--**--**--
 is without a drawback."
 
 Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour
 without saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obliged
 her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying, "But what
 is it that you want to consult me about?"
 
 It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to
 return, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing. She gave the
 history of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;
 for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what
 Miss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct
 between them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one
 pleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was
 some time before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answer
 to her demand of his opinion: he was in a reverie of fond reflection,
 uttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when
 he did awake and understand, he was very decided in opposing what she
 wished.
 
 "Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be
 mortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation
 than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with
 a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why
 should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?"
 
 "If it had been given to me in the first instance," said Fanny, "I
 should not have thought of returning it; but being her brother's
 present, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with
 it, when it is not wanted?"
--**--**--
 from her aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to
 comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the best
 of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a long
 morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often under the
 influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to make this
 last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting; Edmund,
 she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left
 alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the
 housekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_ could
 not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at last to
 think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent off with
 a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, and
 felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in
 it.
 
 As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been
 about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and
 found Edmund in the East room. "Suppose I were to find him there again
 to-day!" said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.
 
 "Fanny," said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up,
 she saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself, standing
 at the head of a different staircase. He came towards her. "You look
 tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far."
 
 "No, I have not been out at all."
 
 "Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had
 better have gone out."
 
 Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and
--**--**--
 Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of
 the two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched
 again, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she
 was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still
 better. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made
 still happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who
 was holding open the door, said, as she passed him, "You must dance
 with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,
 except the first." She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardly
 ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life. Her
 cousins' former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to
 her; she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually practising
 her steps about the drawing-room as long as she could be safe from the
 notice of her aunt Norris, who was entirely taken up at first in fresh
 arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared.
 
 Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any
 other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness still prevailed. It was but
 to think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness
 of Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?
 
 The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation of
 a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused,
 and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every moment had
 its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a struggle
 in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so
--**--**--
 rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner, a voluntary
 partner, secured against the dancing began.
 
 When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself
 for the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were
 immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother's had been,
 and who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious
 to get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second
 necklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended
 compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one
 thing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could
 yet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, "Did he? Did Edmund?
 That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honour
 him beyond expression." And she looked around as if longing to tell him
 so. He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of the room;
 and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,
 they followed with the rest.
 
 Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of
 Miss Crawford's feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were
 playing, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on
 anything serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see how
 everything was done.
 
 In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;
 and the "Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford," was exactly what he had intended
 to hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,
 saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead the
 way and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.
--**--**--
 to please. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter,
 and filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,
 misinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she must be doing so when
 she went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a significant
 look, "Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow?
 He says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The first time
 he ever denied me his confidence! But this is what we all come to.
 All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for
 information. Pray, what is Henry going for?"
 
 Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed.
 
 "Well, then," replied Miss Crawford, laughing, "I must suppose it to be
 purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you
 by the way."
 
 Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss
 Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious,
 or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of
 pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in
 the course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to
 do with it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so
 very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his
 previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for
 the sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to
 be avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she
 could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy
 or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,
--**--**--
 CHAPTER XXIX
 
 The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss
 was given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been
 very punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.
 
 After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the
 breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy
 change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving,
 perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her
 tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in
 William's plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells
 in Mr. Crawford's. She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncle
 intended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other. William was
 gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares
 and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.
 
 Fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think of her
 aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,
 without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her
 when they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit
 her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was
 due to him for a whole fortnight.
 
 It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund
 bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,
 and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but remembrances,
 which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt Bertram--she
 must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little of
 what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work.
--**--**--
 
 The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,
 and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing. But
 at last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss
 Crawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could--"And
 how do _you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long? Being the
 only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.
 You must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?"
 
 "I do not know," said Fanny hesitatingly. "Yes; I had not particularly
 expected it."
 
 "Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the general
 way all young men do."
 
 "He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before."
 
 "He finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very--a very pleasing
 young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not
 seeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the
 case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there
 will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen
 him once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes;
 I think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted,
 Miss Price, in our language--a something between compliments and--and
 love--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So
 many months' acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here.
 Was his letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is
 doing? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?"
 
 "I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe
 it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I
--**--**--
 my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your
 choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish
 and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and
 devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs.
 Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight
 of all the family, indeed! And she has some _true_ friends in it! How
 _they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When
 did you begin to think seriously about her?"
 
 Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though
 nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. "How the pleasing
 plague had stolen on him" he could not say; and before he had expressed
 the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over,
 his sister eagerly interrupted him with, "Ah, my dear Henry, and this
 is what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult
 the Admiral before you made up your mind."
 
 But this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him on
 any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never
 pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.
 
 "When Fanny is known to him," continued Henry, "he will doat on her.
 She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as
 the Admiral, for she he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy
 of language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely
 settled--settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the
 matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my
 business yet."
 
 "Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am
--**--**--
 
 "I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what
 sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense.
 I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their
 cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily
 ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be
 angry," he added, after a moment's silence, and in a cooler tone; "Mrs.
 Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is,
 like other bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and then
 be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose
 her feelings more lasting than other women's, though _I_ was the object
 of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily,
 hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her;
 and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer
 of it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due.
 Now she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten."
 
 "Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or
 forgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her."
 
 "Edmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and
 so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,
 long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together
 do, what do they _do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in
 the world, to what I _shall_ do?"
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXXI
 
 Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an
 earlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were together
--**--**--
 I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly
 disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was
 kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear
 to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from
 Mansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the
 warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were
 difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of
 another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and
 knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,
 trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by
 such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in
 the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your
 brother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday
 to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his
 praise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of
 a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I could
 not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed
 by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarily
 bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together."
 
 "Has this been all _your_ doing, then?" cried Fanny. "Good heaven! how
 very, very kind! Have you really--was it by _your_ desire? I beg your
 pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I
 am stupefied."
 
 Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an
 earlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His
--**--**--
 "Sir Thomas told me 10 would be enough."
 
 Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,
 began to take the matter in another point.
 
 "It is amazing," said she, "how much young people cost their friends,
 what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They
 little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their
 uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are
 my sister Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobody
 would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing
 of what _I_ do for them."
 
 "Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help
 it; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,
 William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I
 shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I
 wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I
 will have two shawls, Fanny."
 
 Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very
 earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. There
 was everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his words
 and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;
 all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits. How
 could _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so
 many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely
 her superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even
 where pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, so
 carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to
--**--**--
 
 "You are mistaken, sir," cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the
 moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; "you are quite
 mistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no
 encouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect
 my exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him,
 that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I begged
 him never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I said as much
 as that and more; and I should have said still more, if I had been quite
 certain of his meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be, I
 could not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended. I thought it
 might all pass for nothing with _him_."
 
 She could say no more; her breath was almost gone.
 
 "Am I to understand," said Sir Thomas, after a few moments' silence,
 "that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?"
 
 "Yes, sir."
 
 "Refuse him?"
 
 "Yes, sir."
 
 "Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?"
 
 "I--I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him."
 
 "This is very strange!" said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.
 "There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Here
 is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything to
 recommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,
 but with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation
 pleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have
 now known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend,
 and he has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose
--**--**--
 _ingratitude_--"
 
 He ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he
 was, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost broke
 by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations,
 so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation! Self-willed,
 obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all this. She had
 deceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion. What was to
 become of her?
 
 "I am very sorry," said she inarticulately, through her tears, "I am
 very sorry indeed."
 
 "Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to
 be long sorry for this day's transactions."
 
 "If it were possible for me to do otherwise" said she, with another
 strong effort; "but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make
 him happy, and that I should be miserable myself."
 
 Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of that
 great black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas
 began to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination, might
 have something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the personal
 entreaty of the young man himself. He knew her to be very timid, and
 exceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her mind
 might be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a little
 patience, and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on the
 lover's side, might work their usual effect on. If the gentleman would
 but persevere, if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began
 to have hopes; and these reflections having passed across his mind and
 cheered it, "Well," said he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less
--**--**--
 fault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is
 a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before--she likes to
 go her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes
 her own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little
 spirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I
 would advise her to get the better of."
 
 As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be
 more unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments
 himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly
 before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to
 perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he thought
 well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have his own
 children's merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She was talking
 _at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.
 
 It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more
 composure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could
 have hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first
 place, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.
 For the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing
 to hope, secondly, that her uncle's displeasure was abating, and would
 abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality, and
 felt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how
 hopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.
 
 When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,
 she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally
--**--**--
 would hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,
 unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.
 How much time she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, is
 another concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady's
 exact estimate of her own perfections.
 
 In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more
 obliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for
 its being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have
 avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally
 opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He
 had no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where
 he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would be
 rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress
 of his success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity
 of making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business
 without delay; though, on Fanny's account, he almost dreaded the
 effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He
 deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,
 by this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those
 well-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable
 things.
 
 Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest
 forbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but
 did observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:
 bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received
 such an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to
 Julia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independently
--**--**--
 against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or movement.
 
 Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, Sir
 Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it was
 really a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had then
 ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree
 of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners;
 and it was so little, so very, very little--every chance, every
 possibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was
 not hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else--that he was
 almost ready to wonder at his friend's perseverance. Fanny was worth it
 all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion of
 mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman
 breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyes
 could discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw
 clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend
 that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at,
 and after dinner.
 
 In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more
 promising. When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his mother
 and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there
 were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing their
 apparently deep tranquillity.
 
 "We have not been so silent all the time," replied his mother. "Fanny
 has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you
 coming." And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air
 of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. "She often
