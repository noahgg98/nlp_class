 tell me I think you must mean a rather well-known hanger-on and emissary
 of the Revolutionary Red Committee.  He says he is an Englishman by
 birth.  We have an idea that he has been for a good few years now a
 secret agent of one of the foreign Embassies in London.’  This woke up my
 memory completely.  He was the vanishing fellow I saw sitting on a chair
 in Baron Stott-Wartenheim’s bathroom.  I told my friend that he was quite
 right.  The fellow was a secret agent to my certain knowledge.
 Afterwards my friend took the trouble to ferret out the complete record
 of that man for me.  I thought I had better know all there was to know;
 but I don’t suppose you want to hear his history now, sir?”
 
 The Assistant Commissioner shook his supported head.  “The history of
 your relations with that useful personage is the only thing that matters
 just now,” he said, closing slowly his weary, deep-set eyes, and then
 opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance.
 
 “There’s nothing official about them,” said the Chief Inspector bitterly.
 “I went into his shop one evening, told him who I was, and reminded him
 of our first meeting.  He didn’t as much as twitch an eyebrow.  He said
 that he was married and settled now, and that all he wanted was not to be
 interfered in his little business.  I took it upon myself to promise him
 that, as long as he didn’t go in for anything obviously outrageous, he
 would be left alone by the police.  That was worth something to him,
 because a word from us to the Custom-House people would have been enough
 to get some of these packages he gets from Paris and Brussels opened in
 Dover, with confiscation to follow for certain, and perhaps a prosecution
--**--**--
 of a great personage.
 
 This fair, smooth-faced young man, whose symmetrically arranged hair gave
 him the air of a large and neat schoolboy, met the Assistant
 Commissioner’s request with a doubtful look, and spoke with bated breath.
 
 “Would he see you?  I don’t know about that.  He has walked over from the
 House an hour ago to talk with the permanent Under-Secretary, and now
 he’s ready to walk back again.  He might have sent for him; but he does
 it for the sake of a little exercise, I suppose.  It’s all the exercise
 he can find time for while this session lasts.  I don’t complain; I
 rather enjoy these little strolls.  He leans on my arm, and doesn’t open
 his lips.  But, I say, he’s very tired, and—well—not in the sweetest of
 tempers just now.”
 
 “It’s in connection with that Greenwich affair.”
 
 “Oh!  I say!  He’s very bitter against you people.  But I will go and
 see, if you insist.”
 
 “Do.  That’s a good fellow,” said the Assistant Commissioner.
 
 The unpaid secretary admired this pluck.  Composing for himself an
 innocent face, he opened a door, and went in with the assurance of a nice
 and privileged child.  And presently he reappeared, with a nod to the
 Assistant Commissioner, who passing through the same door left open for
 him, found himself with the great personage in a large room.
 
 Vast in bulk and stature, with a long white face, which, broadened at the
 base by a big double chin, appeared egg-shaped in the fringe of thin
 greyish whisker, the great personage seemed an expanding man.
 Unfortunate from a tailoring point of view, the cross-folds in the middle
 of a buttoned black coat added to the impression, as if the fastenings of
 the garment were tried to the utmost.  From the head, set upward on a
--**--**--
 with a sudden conclusion, which, reproducing the opening statement,
 pleasantly surprised Sir Ethelred by its apparent swiftness and force.
 
 “The kind of thing which meets us under the surface of this affair,
 otherwise without gravity, is unusual—in this precise form at least—and
 requires special treatment.”
 
 The tone of Sir Ethelred was deepened, full of conviction.
 
 “I should think so—involving the Ambassador of a foreign power!”
 
 “Oh!  The Ambassador!” protested the other, erect and slender, allowing
 himself a mere half smile.  “It would be stupid of me to advance anything
 of the kind.  And it is absolutely unnecessary, because if I am right in
 my surmises, whether ambassador or hall porter it’s a mere detail.”
 
 Sir Ethelred opened a wide mouth, like a cavern, into which the hooked
 nose seemed anxious to peer; there came from it a subdued rolling sound,
 as from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop.
 
 “No!  These people are too impossible.  What do they mean by importing
 their methods of Crim-Tartary here?  A Turk would have more decency.”
 
 “You forget, Sir Ethelred, that strictly speaking we know nothing
 positively—as yet.”
 
 “No!  But how would you define it?  Shortly?”
 
 “Barefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a peculiar sort.”
 
 “We can’t put up with the innocence of nasty little children,” said the
 great and expanded personage, expanding a little more, as it were.  The
 haughty drooping glance struck crushingly the carpet at the Assistant
 Commissioner’s feet.  “They’ll have to get a hard rap on the knuckles
 over this affair.  We must be in a position to—What is your general idea,
 stated shortly?  No need to go into details.”
 
 “No, Sir Ethelred.  In principle, I should lay it down that the existence
 of secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the
 positive dangers of the evil against which they are used.  That the spy
--**--**--
 presenting this obscure matter to you without details.”
 
 “He would, would he?” muttered the proud head of Sir Ethelred from its
 lofty elevation.
 
 “I am afraid so—with an indignation and disgust of which you or I can
 have no idea.  He’s an excellent servant.  We must not put an undue
 strain on his loyalty.  That’s always a mistake.  Besides, I want a free
 hand—a freer hand than it would be perhaps advisable to give Chief
 Inspector Heat.  I haven’t the slightest wish to spare this man Verloc.
 He will, I imagine, be extremely startled to find his connection with
 this affair, whatever it may be, brought home to him so quickly.
 Frightening him will not be very difficult.  But our true objective lies
 behind him somewhere.  I want your authority to give him such assurances
 of personal safety as I may think proper.”
 
 “Certainly,” said the Personage on the hearthrug.  “Find out as much as
 you can; find it out in your own way.”
 
 “I must set about it without loss of time, this very evening,” said the
 Assistant Commissioner.
 
 Sir Ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails, and tilting back his
 head, looked at him steadily.
 
 “We’ll have a late sitting to-night,” he said.  “Come to the House with
 your discoveries if we are not gone home.  I’ll warn Toodles to look out
 for you.  He’ll take you into my room.”
 
 The numerous family and the wide connections of the youthful-looking
 Private Secretary cherished for him the hope of an austere and exalted
 destiny.  Meantime the social sphere he adorned in his hours of idleness
 chose to pet him under the above nickname.  And Sir Ethelred, hearing it
 on the lips of his wife and girls every day (mostly at breakfast-time),
 had conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption.
--**--**--
 the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence, and
 when he emerged into the Strand out of a narrow street by the side of
 Charing Cross Station the genius of the locality assimilated him.  He
 might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen
 of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners.
 
 He came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement, and waited.  His
 exercised eyes had made out in the confused movements of lights and
 shadows thronging the roadway the crawling approach of a hansom.  He gave
 no sign; but when the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his
 feet he dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel, and spoke
 up through the little trap door almost before the man gazing supinely
 ahead from his perch was aware of having been boarded by a fare.
 
 It was not a long drive.  It ended by signal abruptly, nowhere in
 particular, between two lamp-posts before a large drapery establishment—a
 long range of shops already lapped up in sheets of corrugated iron for
 the night.  Tendering a coin through the trap door the fare slipped out
 and away, leaving an effect of uncanny, eccentric ghastliness upon the
 driver’s mind.  But the size of the coin was satisfactory to his touch,
 and his education not being literary, he remained untroubled by the fear
 of finding it presently turned to a dead leaf in his pocket.  Raised
 above the world of fares by the nature of his calling, he contemplated
 their actions with a limited interest.  The sharp pulling of his horse
 right round expressed his philosophy.
 
 Meantime the Assistant Commissioner was already giving his order to a
 waiter in a little Italian restaurant round the corner—one of those traps
--**--**--
 before them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability.  Neither
 was their personality stamped in any way, professionally, socially or
 racially.  They seemed created for the Italian restaurant, unless the
 Italian restaurant had been perchance created for them.  But that last
 hypothesis was unthinkable, since one could not place them anywhere
 outside those special establishments.  One never met these enigmatical
 persons elsewhere.  It was impossible to form a precise idea what
 occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night.
 And he himself had become unplaced.  It would have been impossible for
 anybody to guess his occupation.  As to going to bed, there was a doubt
 even in his own mind.  Not indeed in regard to his domicile itself, but
 very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return
 there.  A pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard
 the glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled
 thud.  He advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp
 plaster interspersed with lamps, and enveloped, oppressed, penetrated,
 choked, and suffocated by the blackness of a wet London night, which is
 composed of soot and drops of water.
 
 Brett Street was not very far away.  It branched off, narrow, from the
 side of an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious
 houses, temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night.  Only
 a fruiterer’s stall at the corner made a violent blaze of light and
 colour.  Beyond all was black, and the few people passing in that
 direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and
 lemons.  No footsteps echoed.  They would never be heard of again.  The
 adventurous head of the Special Crimes Department watched these
 disappearances from a distance with an interested eye.  He felt

 CHAPTER VIII
 
 
 Having infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat into the
 chilly interest of several licensed victuallers (the acquaintances once
 upon a time of her late unlucky husband), Mrs Verloc’s mother had at last
 secured her admission to certain almshouses founded by a wealthy
 innkeeper for the destitute widows of the trade.
 
 This end, conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart, the old woman
 had pursued with secrecy and determination.  That was the time when her
 daughter Winnie could not help passing a remark to Mr Verloc that “mother
 has been spending half-crowns and five shillings almost every day this
 last week in cab fares.”  But the remark was not made grudgingly.  Winnie
 respected her mother’s infirmities.  She was only a little surprised at
 this sudden mania for locomotion.  Mr Verloc, who was sufficiently
 magnificent in his way, had grunted the remark impatiently aside as
 interfering with his meditations.  These were frequent, deep, and
 prolonged; they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings.
 Distinctly more important, and beyond all comparison more difficult to
 consider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity.
 
 Her object attained in astute secrecy, the heroic old woman had made a
 clean breast of it to Mrs Verloc.  Her soul was triumphant and her heart
 tremulous.  Inwardly she quaked, because she dreaded and admired the
 calm, self-contained character of her daughter Winnie, whose displeasure
 was made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences.  But she did
 not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of
 venerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin,
 the floating ampleness of her ancient form, and the impotent condition of
 her legs.
 
 The shock of the information was so unexpected that Mrs Verloc, against
 her usual practice when addressed, interrupted the domestic occupation
--**--**--
 At last Winnie observed: “This isn’t a very good horse.”
 
 Her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead, immovable.  On
 the box, Stevie shut his vacant mouth first, in order to ejaculate
 earnestly: “Don’t.”
 
 The driver, holding high the reins twisted around the hook, took no
 notice.  Perhaps he had not heard.  Stevie’s breast heaved.
 
 “Don’t whip.”
 
 The man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours
 bristling with white hairs.  His little red eyes glistened with moisture.
 His big lips had a violet tint.  They remained closed.  With the dirty
 back of his whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous
 chin.
 
 “You mustn’t,” stammered out Stevie violently.  “It hurts.”
 
 “Mustn’t whip,” queried the other in a thoughtful whisper, and
 immediately whipped.  He did this, not because his soul was cruel and his
 heart evil, but because he had to earn his fare.  And for a time the
 walls of St Stephen’s, with its towers and pinnacles, contemplated in
 immobility and silence a cab that jingled.  It rolled too, however.  But
 on the bridge there was a commotion.  Stevie suddenly proceeded to get
 down from the box.  There were shouts on the pavement, people ran
 forward, the driver pulled up, whispering curses of indignation and
 astonishment.  Winnie lowered the window, and put her head out, white as
 a ghost.  In the depths of the cab, her mother was exclaiming, in tones
 of anguish: “Is that boy hurt?  Is that boy hurt?”
 
 Stevie was not hurt, he had not even fallen, but excitement as usual had
 robbed him of the power of connected speech.  He could do no more than
 stammer at the window.  “Too heavy.  Too heavy.”  Winnie put out her hand
 on to his shoulder.
 
 “Stevie!  Get up on the box directly, and don’t try to get down again.”
--**--**--
 had been broken by Stevie’s outbreak.  Winnie raised her voice.
 
 “You’ve done what you wanted, mother.  You’ll have only yourself to thank
 for it if you aren’t happy afterwards.  And I don’t think you’ll be.
 That I don’t.  Weren’t you comfortable enough in the house?  Whatever
 people’ll think of us—you throwing yourself like this on a Charity?”
 
 “My dear,” screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise, “you’ve been
 the best of daughters to me.  As to Mr Verloc—there—”
 
 Words failing her on the subject of Mr Verloc’s excellence, she turned
 her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab.  Then she averted her head
 on the pretence of looking out of the window, as if to judge of their
 progress.  It was insignificant, and went on close to the curbstone.
 Night, the early dirty night, the sinister, noisy, hopeless and rowdy
 night of South London, had overtaken her on her last cab drive.  In the
 gas-light of the low-fronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange
 hue under a black and mauve bonnet.
 
 Mrs Verloc’s mother’s complexion had become yellow by the effect of age
 and from a natural predisposition to biliousness, favoured by the trials
 of a difficult and worried existence, first as wife, then as widow.  It
 was a complexion, that under the influence of a blush would take on an
 orange tint.  And this woman, modest indeed but hardened in the fires of
 adversity, of an age, moreover, when blushes are not expected, had
 positively blushed before her daughter.  In the privacy of a
 four-wheeler, on her way to a charity cottage (one of a row) which by the
 exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation, might
 well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still
--**--**--
 obliterated every sensation of onward movement; and the effect was of
 being shaken in a stationary apparatus like a mediæval device for the
 punishment of crime, or some very newfangled invention for the cure of a
 sluggish liver.  It was extremely distressing; and the raising of Mrs
 Verloc’s mother’s voice sounded like a wail of pain.
 
 “I know, my dear, you’ll come to see me as often as you can spare the
 time.  Won’t you?”
 
 “Of course,” answered Winnie shortly, staring straight before her.
 
 And the cab jolted in front of a steamy, greasy shop in a blaze of gas
 and in the smell of fried fish.
 
 The old woman raised a wail again.
 
 “And, my dear, I must see that poor boy every Sunday.  He won’t mind
 spending the day with his old mother—”
 
 Winnie screamed out stolidly:
 
 “Mind!  I should think not.  That poor boy will miss you something cruel.
 I wish you had thought a little of that, mother.”
 
 Not think of it!  The heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient
 object like a billiard ball, which had tried to jump out of her throat.
 Winnie sat mute for a while, pouting at the front of the cab, then
 snapped out, which was an unusual tone with her:
 
 “I expect I’ll have a job with him at first, he’ll be that restless—”
 
 “Whatever you do, don’t let him worry your husband, my dear.”
 
 Thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation.
 And the cab jolted.  Mrs Verloc’s mother expressed some misgivings.
 Could Stevie be trusted to come all that way alone?  Winnie maintained
 that he was much less “absent-minded” now.  They agreed as to that.  It
 could not be denied.  Much less—hardly at all.  They shouted at each
 other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness.  But suddenly the
--**--**--
 elevated by the effect of emaciation.  The little stiff tail seemed to
 have been fitted in for a heartless joke; and at the other end the thin,
 flat neck, like a plank covered with old horse-hide, drooped to the
 ground under the weight of an enormous bony head.  The ears hung at
 different angles, negligently; and the macabre figure of that mute
 dweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the
 muggy stillness of the air.
 
 The cabman struck lightly Stevie’s breast with the iron hook protruding
 from a ragged, greasy sleeve.
 
 “Look ’ere, young feller.  ’Ow’d _you_ like to sit behind this ’oss up to
 two o’clock in the morning p’raps?”
 
 Stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with red-edged lids.
 
 “He ain’t lame,” pursued the other, whispering with energy.  “He ain’t
 got no sore places on ’im.  ’Ere he is.  ’Ow would _you_ like—”
 
 His strained, extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of
 vehement secrecy.  Stevie’s vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread.
 
 “You may well look!  Till three and four o’clock in the morning.  Cold
 and ’ungry.  Looking for fares.  Drunks.”
 
 His jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs; and like Virgil’s
 Silenus, who, his face smeared with the juice of berries, discoursed of
 Olympian Gods to the innocent shepherds of Sicily, he talked to Stevie of
 domestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and
 immortality by no means assured.
 
 “I am a night cabby, I am,” he whispered, with a sort of boastful
 exasperation.  “I’ve got to take out what they will blooming well give me
 at the yard.  I’ve got my missus and four kids at ’ome.”
 
 The monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike
 the world dumb.  A silence reigned during which the flanks of the old
--**--**--
 each other.  It was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he
 could remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of
 corresponding idea.  And, as a matter of fact, he got it at last.  He
 hung back to utter it at once.
 
 “Bad world for poor people.”
 
 Directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was
 familiar to him already in all its consequences.  This circumstance
 strengthened his conviction immensely, but also augmented his
 indignation.  Somebody, he felt, ought to be punished for it—punished
 with great severity.  Being no sceptic, but a moral creature, he was in a
 manner at the mercy of his righteous passions.
 
 “Beastly!” he added concisely.
 
 It was clear to Mrs Verloc that he was greatly excited.
 
 “Nobody can help that,” she said.  “Do come along.  Is that the way
 you’re taking care of me?”
 
 Stevie mended his pace obediently.  He prided himself on being a good
 brother.  His morality, which was very complete, demanded that from him.
 Yet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister Winnie who
 was good.  Nobody could help that!  He came along gloomily, but presently
 he brightened up.  Like the rest of mankind, perplexed by the mystery of
 the universe, he had his moments of consoling trust in the organised
 powers of the earth.
 
 “Police,” he suggested confidently.
 
 “The police aren’t for that,” observed Mrs Verloc cursorily, hurrying on
 her way.
 
 Stevie’s face lengthened considerably.  He was thinking.  The more
 intense his thinking, the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw.
 
 And it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his
 intellectual enterprise.
 
 “Not for that?” he mumbled, resigned but surprised.  “Not for that?”  He
 had formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as
--**--**--
 reading, or at any rate looking at, behind the counter, and in the
 expiring clatter of the door-bell beheld Winnie, his wife, enter and
 cross the shop on her way upstairs, followed by Stevie, his
 brother-in-law.  The sight of his wife was agreeable to Mr Verloc.  It
 was his idiosyncrasy.  The figure of his brother-in-law remained
 imperceptible to him because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had
 fallen like a veil between Mr Verloc and the appearances of the world of
 senses.  He looked after his wife fixedly, without a word, as though she
 had been a phantom.  His voice for home use was husky and placid, but now
 it was heard not at all.  It was not heard at supper, to which he was
 called by his wife in the usual brief manner: “Adolf.”  He sat down to
 consume it without conviction, wearing his hat pushed far back on his
 head.  It was not devotion to an outdoor life, but the frequentation of
 foreign cafés which was responsible for that habit, investing with a
 character of unceremonious impermanency Mr Verloc’s steady fidelity to
 his own fireside.  Twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose
 without a word, disappeared into the shop, and came back silently.
 During these absences Mrs Verloc, becoming acutely aware of the vacant
 place at her right hand, missed her mother very much, and stared stonily;
 while Stevie, from the same reason, kept on shuffling his feet, as though
 the floor under the table were uncomfortably hot.  When Mr Verloc
 returned to sit in his place, like the very embodiment of silence, the
 character of Mrs Verloc’s stare underwent a subtle change, and Stevie
 ceased to fidget with his feet, because of his great and awed regard for
 his sister’s husband.  He directed at him glances of respectful
--**--**--
 earthly good going out.  He could not find anywhere in London what he
 wanted.  But he went out.  He led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark
 streets, through lighted streets, in and out of two flash bars, as if in
 a half-hearted attempt to make a night of it, and finally back again to
 his menaced home, where he sat down fatigued behind the counter, and they
 crowded urgently round him, like a pack of hungry black hounds.  After
 locking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with
 him—a dreadful escort for a man going to bed.  His wife had preceded him
 some time before, and with her ample form defined vaguely under the
 counterpane, her head on the pillow, and a hand under the cheek offered
 to his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of
 an equable soul.  Her big eyes stared wide open, inert and dark against
 the snowy whiteness of the linen.  She did not move.
 
 She had an equable soul.  She felt profoundly that things do not stand
 much looking into.  She made her force and her wisdom of that instinct.
 But the taciturnity of Mr Verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a
 good many days.  It was, as a matter of fact, affecting her nerves.
 Recumbent and motionless, she said placidly:
 
 “You’ll catch cold walking about in your socks like this.”
 
 This speech, becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the
 woman, took Mr Verloc unawares.  He had left his boots downstairs, but he
 had forgotten to put on his slippers, and he had been turning about the
 bedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage.  At the sound of his
 wife’s voice he stopped and stared at her with a somnambulistic,
--**--**--
 very unusual for Mr Verloc to take such a trip.  He renewed his stock
 from Paris and Brussels.  Often he went over to make his purchases
 personally.  A little select connection of amateurs was forming around
 the shop in Brett Street, a secret connection eminently proper for any
 business undertaken by Mr Verloc, who, by a mystic accord of temperament
 and necessity, had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life.
 
 He waited for a while, then added: “I’ll be away a week or perhaps a
 fortnight.  Get Mrs Neale to come for the day.”
 
 Mrs Neale was the charwoman of Brett Street.  Victim of her marriage with
 a debauched joiner, she was oppressed by the needs of many infant
 children.  Red-armed, and aproned in coarse sacking up to the arm-pits,
 she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soap-suds and rum, in
 the uproar of scrubbing, in the clatter of tin pails.
 
 Mrs Verloc, full of deep purpose, spoke in the tone of the shallowest
 indifference.
 
 “There is no need to have the woman here all day.  I shall do very well
 with Stevie.”
 
 She let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the
 abyss of eternity, and asked:
 
 “Shall I put the light out?”
 
 Mr Verloc snapped at his wife huskily.
 
 “Put it out.”
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IX
 
 
 Mr Verloc returning from the Continent at the end of ten days, brought
 back a mind evidently unrefreshed by the wonders of foreign travel and a
 countenance unlighted by the joys of home-coming.  He entered in the
 clatter of the shop bell with an air of sombre and vexed exhaustion.  His
 bag in hand, his head lowered, he strode straight behind the counter, and
 let himself fall into the chair, as though he had tramped all the way
--**--**--
 “He won’t.  You don’t know him.  That boy just worships you.  But if you
 should miss him—”
 
 Mrs Verloc paused for a moment, but only for a moment.
 
 “You just go on, and have your walk out.  Don’t worry.  He’ll be all
 right.  He’s sure to turn up safe here before very long.”
 
 This optimism procured for Mr Verloc his fourth surprise of the day.
 
 “Is he?” he grunted doubtfully.  But perhaps his brother-in-law was not
 such an idiot as he looked.  His wife would know best.  He turned away
 his heavy eyes, saying huskily: “Well, let him come along, then,” and
 relapsed into the clutches of black care, that perhaps prefers to sit
 behind a horseman, but knows also how to tread close on the heels of
 people not sufficiently well off to keep horses—like Mr Verloc, for
 instance.
 
 Winnie, at the shop door, did not see this fatal attendant upon Mr
 Verloc’s walks.  She watched the two figures down the squalid street, one
 tall and burly, the other slight and short, with a thin neck, and the
 peaked shoulders raised slightly under the large semi-transparent ears.
 The material of their overcoats was the same, their hats were black and
 round in shape.  Inspired by the similarity of wearing apparel, Mrs
 Verloc gave rein to her fancy.
 
 “Might be father and son,” she said to herself.  She thought also that Mr
 Verloc was as much of a father as poor Stevie ever had in his life.  She
 was aware also that it was her work.  And with peaceful pride she
 congratulated herself on a certain resolution she had taken a few years
 before.  It had cost her some effort, and even a few tears.
 
 She congratulated herself still more on observing in the course of days
 that Mr Verloc seemed to be taking kindly to Stevie’s companionship.
--**--**--
 himself, and leave him all safe with Michaelis.
 
 He carried out this scheme on the very next day.  Stevie offered no
 objection.  He seemed rather eager, in a bewildered sort of way.  He
 turned his candid gaze inquisitively to Mr Verloc’s heavy countenance at
 frequent intervals, especially when his sister was not looking at him.
 His expression was proud, apprehensive, and concentrated, like that of a
 small child entrusted for the first time with a box of matches and the
 permission to strike a light.  But Mrs Verloc, gratified by her brother’s
 docility, recommended him not to dirty his clothes unduly in the country.
 At this Stevie gave his sister, guardian and protector a look, which for
 the first time in his life seemed to lack the quality of perfect
 childlike trustfulness.  It was haughtily gloomy.  Mrs Verloc smiled.
 
 “Goodness me!  You needn’t be offended.  You know you do get yourself
 very untidy when you get a chance, Stevie.”
 
 Mr Verloc was already gone some way down the street.
 
 Thus in consequence of her mother’s heroic proceedings, and of her
 brother’s absence on this villegiature, Mrs Verloc found herself oftener
 than usual all alone not only in the shop, but in the house.  For Mr
 Verloc had to take his walks.  She was alone longer than usual on the day
 of the attempted bomb outrage in Greenwich Park, because Mr Verloc went
 out very early that morning and did not come back till nearly dusk.  She
 did not mind being alone.  She had no desire to go out.  The weather was
 too bad, and the shop was cosier than the streets.  Sitting behind the
 counter with some sewing, she did not raise her eyes from her work when
 Mr Verloc entered in the aggressive clatter of the bell.  She had
--**--**--
 evening received an unexpected development.  It was not of going out in
 the evening that Mr Verloc was thinking.  His thoughts embraced a vaster
 scheme.  From moody and incomplete phrases it became apparent that Mr
 Verloc had been considering the expediency of emigrating.  It was not
 very clear whether he had in his mind France or California.
 
 The utter unexpectedness, improbability, and inconceivableness of such an
 event robbed this vague declaration of all its effect.  Mrs Verloc, as
 placidly as if her husband had been threatening her with the end of the
 world, said:
 
 “The idea!”
 
 Mr Verloc declared himself sick and tired of everything, and besides—She
 interrupted him.
 
 “You’ve a bad cold.”
 
 It was indeed obvious that Mr Verloc was not in his usual state,
 physically and even mentally.  A sombre irresolution held him silent for
 a while.  Then he murmured a few ominous generalities on the theme of
 necessity.
 
 “Will have to,” repeated Winnie, sitting calmly back, with folded arms,
 opposite her husband.  “I should like to know who’s to make you.  You
 ain’t a slave.  No one need be a slave in this country—and don’t you make
 yourself one.”  She paused, and with invincible and steady candour.  “The
 business isn’t so bad,” she went on.  “You’ve a comfortable home.”
 
 She glanced all round the parlour, from the corner cupboard to the good
 fire in the grate.  Ensconced cosily behind the shop of doubtful wares,
 with the mysteriously dim window, and its door suspiciously ajar in the
 obscure and narrow street, it was in all essentials of domestic propriety
 and domestic comfort a respectable home.  Her devoted affection missed
 out of it her brother Stevie, now enjoying a damp villegiature in the
 Kentish lanes under the care of Mr Michaelis.  She missed him poignantly,
 with all the force of her protecting passion.  This was the boy’s home
--**--**--
 She turned her head over her shoulder and gave that man planted heavily
 in front of the fireplace a glance, half arch, half cruel, out of her
 large eyes—a glance of which the Winnie of the Belgravian mansion days
 would have been incapable, because of her respectability and her
 ignorance.  But the man was her husband now, and she was no longer
 ignorant.  She kept it on him for a whole second, with her grave face
 motionless like a mask, while she said playfully:
 
 “You couldn’t.  You would miss me too much.”
 
 Mr Verloc started forward.
 
 “Exactly,” he said in a louder tone, throwing his arms out and making a
 step towards her.  Something wild and doubtful in his expression made it
 appear uncertain whether he meant to strangle or to embrace his wife.
 But Mrs Verloc’s attention was called away from that manifestation by the
 clatter of the shop bell.
 
 “Shop, Adolf.  You go.”
 
 He stopped, his arms came down slowly.
 
 “You go,” repeated Mrs Verloc.  “I’ve got my apron on.”
 
 Mr Verloc obeyed woodenly, stony-eyed, and like an automaton whose face
 had been painted red.  And this resemblance to a mechanical figure went
 so far that he had an automaton’s absurd air of being aware of the
 machinery inside of him.
 
 He closed the parlour door, and Mrs Verloc moving briskly, carried the
 tray into the kitchen.  She washed the cups and some other things before
 she stopped in her work to listen.  No sound reached her.  The customer
 was a long time in the shop.  It was a customer, because if he had not
 been Mr Verloc would have taken him inside.  Undoing the strings of her
 apron with a jerk, she threw it on a chair, and walked back to the
 parlour slowly.
 
 At that precise moment Mr Verloc entered from the shop.
--**--**--
 received it without another word, and stood still till the bell,
 clattering after Mr Verloc and Mr Verloc’s visitor, had quieted down.
 Only then she peeped in at the amount, drawing the notes out for the
 purpose.  After this inspection she looked round thoughtfully, with an
 air of mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house.  This abode of
 her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe as though it had
 been situated in the midst of a forest.  No receptacle she could think of
 amongst the solid, heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and
 particularly tempting to her conception of a house-breaker.  It was an
 ideal conception, endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous
 insight.  The till was not to be thought of.  It was the first spot a
 thief would make for.  Mrs Verloc unfastening hastily a couple of hooks,
 slipped the pocket-book under the bodice of her dress.  Having thus
 disposed of her husband’s capital, she was rather glad to hear the
 clatter of the door bell, announcing an arrival.  Assuming the fixed,
 unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual
 customer, she walked in behind the counter.
 
 A man standing in the middle of the shop was inspecting it with a swift,
 cool, all-round glance.  His eyes ran over the walls, took in the
 ceiling, noted the floor—all in a moment.  The points of a long fair
 moustache fell below the line of the jaw.  He smiled the smile of an old
 if distant acquaintance, and Mrs Verloc remembered having seen him
 before.  Not a customer.  She softened her “customer stare” to mere
 indifference, and faced him across the counter.
 
 He approached, on his side, confidentially, but not too markedly so.
 
 “Husband at home, Mrs Verloc?” he asked in an easy, full tone.
--**--**--
 “So your husband went out a quarter of an hour ago!  And he didn’t say
 when he would be back?”
 
 “He didn’t go out alone,” Mrs Verloc let fall negligently.
 
 “A friend?”
 
 Mrs Verloc touched the back of her hair.  It was in perfect order.
 
 “A stranger who called.”
 
 “I see.  What sort of man was that stranger?  Would you mind telling me?”
 
 Mrs Verloc did not mind.  And when Chief Inspector Heat heard of a man
 dark, thin, with a long face and turned up moustaches, he gave signs of
 perturbation, and exclaimed:
 
 “Dash me if I didn’t think so!  He hasn’t lost any time.”
 
 He was intensely disgusted in the secrecy of his heart at the unofficial
 conduct of his immediate chief.  But he was not quixotic.  He lost all
 desire to await Mr Verloc’s return.  What they had gone out for he did
 not know, but he imagined it possible that they would return together.
 The case is not followed properly, it’s being tampered with, he thought
 bitterly.
 
 “I am afraid I haven’t time to wait for your husband,” he said.
 
 Mrs Verloc received this declaration listlessly.  Her detachment had
 impressed Chief Inspector Heat all along.  At this precise moment it
 whetted his curiosity.  Chief Inspector Heat hung in the wind, swayed by
 his passions like the most private of citizens.
 
 “I think,” he said, looking at her steadily, “that you could give me a
 pretty good notion of what’s going on if you liked.”
 
 Forcing her fine, inert eyes to return his gaze, Mrs Verloc murmured:
 
 “Going on!  What _is_ going on?”
 
 “Why, the affair I came to talk about a little with your husband.”
 
 That day Mrs Verloc had glanced at a morning paper as usual.  But she had
 not stirred out of doors.  The newsboys never invaded Brett Street.  It
--**--**--
 He’ll have to manage this little affair all by himself.  But don’t you
 make a mistake, it’s I who found you out.”
 
 Then she heard only muttering.  Inspector Heat must have been showing to
 Mr Verloc the piece of Stevie’s overcoat, because Stevie’s sister,
 guardian, and protector heard her husband a little louder.
 
 “I never noticed that she had hit upon that dodge.”
 
 Again for a time Mrs Verloc heard nothing but murmurs, whose
 mysteriousness was less nightmarish to her brain than the horrible
 suggestions of shaped words.  Then Chief Inspector Heat, on the other
 side of the door, raised his voice.
 
 “You must have been mad.”
 
 And Mr Verloc’s voice answered, with a sort of gloomy fury:
 
 “I have been mad for a month or more, but I am not mad now.  It’s all
 over.  It shall all come out of my head, and hang the consequences.”
 
 There was a silence, and then Private Citizen Heat murmured:
 
 “What’s coming out?”
 
 “Everything,” exclaimed the voice of Mr Verloc, and then sank very low.
 
 After a while it rose again.
 
 “You have known me for several years now, and you’ve found me useful,
 too.  You know I was a straight man.  Yes, straight.”
 
 This appeal to old acquaintance must have been extremely distasteful to
 the Chief Inspector.
 
 His voice took on a warning note.
 
 “Don’t you trust so much to what you have been promised.  If I were you I
 would clear out.  I don’t think we will run after you.”
 
 Mr Verloc was heard to laugh a little.
 
 “Oh yes; you hope the others will get rid of me for you—don’t you?  No,
 no; you don’t shake me off now.  I have been a straight man to those
 people too long, and now everything must come out.”
 
 “Let it come out, then,” the indifferent voice of Chief Inspector Heat
--**--**--
 opened the door.  Mrs Verloc, behind the counter, might have heard but
 did not see his departure, pursued by the aggressive clatter of the bell.
 She sat at her post of duty behind the counter.  She sat rigidly erect in
 the chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her
 feet.  The palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face, with
 the tips of the fingers contracted against the forehead, as though the
 skin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently.  The
 perfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and
 despair, all the potential violence of tragic passions, better than any
 shallow display of shrieks, with the beating of a distracted head against
 the walls, could have done.  Chief Inspector Heat, crossing the shop at
 his busy, swinging pace, gave her only a cursory glance.  And when the
 cracked bell ceased to tremble on its curved ribbon of steel nothing
 stirred near Mrs Verloc, as if her attitude had the locking power of a
 spell.  Even the butterfly-shaped gas flames posed on the ends of the
 suspended T-bracket burned without a quiver.  In that shop of shady wares
 fitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown, which seemed to devour the
 sheen of the light, the gold circlet of the wedding ring on Mrs Verloc’s
 left hand glittered exceedingly with the untarnished glory of a piece
 from some splendid treasure of jewels, dropped in a dust-bin.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER X
 
 
 The Assistant Commissioner, driven rapidly in a hansom from the
 neighbourhood of Soho in the direction of Westminster, got out at the
 very centre of the Empire on which the sun never sets.  Some stalwart
 constables, who did not seem particularly impressed by the duty of
 watching the august spot, saluted him.  Penetrating through a portal by
--**--**--
 
 The Assistant Commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance.  Till they came
 to the door of the great man’s room, Toodles preserved a scandalised and
 solemn silence, as though he were offended with the Assistant
 Commissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and disturbing fact.  It
 revolutionised his idea of the Explorers’ Club’s extreme selectness, of
 its social purity.  Toodles was revolutionary only in politics; his
 social beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve unchanged
 through all the years allotted to him on this earth which, upon the
 whole, he believed to be a nice place to live on.
 
 He stood aside.
 
 “Go in without knocking,” he said.
 
 Shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted to the room
 something of a forest’s deep gloom.  The haughty eyes were physically the
 great man’s weak point.  This point was wrapped up in secrecy.  When an
 opportunity offered, he rested them conscientiously.
 
 The Assistant Commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale hand
 supporting a big head, and concealing the upper part of a big pale face.
 An open despatch-box stood on the writing-table near a few oblong sheets
 of paper and a scattered handful of quill pens.  There was absolutely
 nothing else on the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette
 draped in a toga, mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility.  The
 Assistant Commissioner, invited to take a chair, sat down.  In the dim
 light, the salient points of his personality, the long face, the black
 hair, his lankness, made him look more foreign than ever.
 
 The great man manifested no surprise, no eagerness, no sentiment
 whatever.  The attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was
 profoundly meditative.  He did not alter it the least bit.  But his tone
 was not dreamy.
 
 “Well!  What is it that you’ve found out already?  You came upon
--**--**--
 night.  I found him under the influence of that reaction which follows
 the effort of crime.  The man cannot be defined as a hardened criminal.
 It is obvious that he did not plan the death of that wretched lad—his
 brother-in-law.  That was a shock to him—I could see that.  Perhaps he is
 a man of strong sensibilities.  Perhaps he was even fond of the lad—who
 knows?  He might have hoped that the fellow would get clear away; in
 which case it would have been almost impossible to bring this thing home
 to anyone.  At any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for
 him.”
 
 The Assistant Commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect for a
 moment.
 
 “Though how, in that last case, he could hope to have his own share in
 the business concealed is more than I can tell,” he continued, in his
 ignorance of poor Stevie’s devotion to Mr Verloc (who was _good_), and of
 his truly peculiar dumbness, which in the old affair of fireworks on the
 stairs had for many years resisted entreaties, coaxing, anger, and other
 means of investigation used by his beloved sister.  For Stevie was loyal.
 . . .  “No, I can’t imagine.  It’s possible that he never thought of that
 at all.  It sounds an extravagant way of putting it, Sir Ethelred, but
 his state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who, after
 committing suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles,
 had discovered that it did nothing of the kind.”
 
 The Assistant Commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic voice.
 But in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant language,
 and the great man was not offended.  A slight jerky movement of the big
 body half lost in the gloom of the green silk shades, of the big head
--**--**--
 Mr Vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive policeman
 was driving at.  Descended from generations victimised by the instruments
 of an arbitrary power, he was racially, nationally, and individually
 afraid of the police.  It was an inherited weakness, altogether
 independent of his judgment, of his reason, of his experience.  He was
 born to it.  But that sentiment, which resembled the irrational horror
 some people have of cats, did not stand in the way of his immense
 contempt for the English police.  He finished the sentence addressed to
 the great lady, and turned slightly in his chair.
 
 “You mean that we have a great experience of these people.  Yes; indeed,
 we suffer greatly from their activity, while you”—Mr Vladimir hesitated
 for a moment, in smiling perplexity—“while you suffer their presence
 gladly in your midst,” he finished, displaying a dimple on each
 clean-shaven cheek.  Then he added more gravely: “I may even say—because
 you do.”
 
 When Mr Vladimir ceased speaking the Assistant Commissioner lowered his
 glance, and the conversation dropped.  Almost immediately afterwards Mr
 Vladimir took leave.
 
 Directly his back was turned on the couch the Assistant Commissioner rose
 too.
 
 “I thought you were going to stay and take Annie home,” said the lady
 patroness of Michaelis.
 
 “I find that I’ve yet a little work to do to-night.”
 
 “In connection—?”
 
 “Well, yes—in a way.”
 
 “Tell me, what is it really—this horror?”
 
 “It’s difficult to say what it is, but it may yet be a _cause célèbre_,”
 said the Assistant Commissioner.
 
 He left the drawing-room hurriedly, and found Mr Vladimir still in the
 hall, wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief.
 Behind him a footman waited, holding his overcoat.  Another stood ready
 to open the door.  The Assistant Commissioner was duly helped into his
 coat, and let out at once.  After descending the front steps he stopped,
--**--**--
 of a man literally blown to shreds, have found the organiser of the
 attempt, and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him.  And we could
 have gone further; only we stopped at the limits of our territory.”
 
 “So this instructive crime was planned abroad,” Mr Vladimir said quickly.
 “You admit it was planned abroad?”
 
 “Theoretically.  Theoretically only, on foreign territory; abroad only by
 a fiction,” said the Assistant Commissioner, alluding to the character of
 Embassies, which are supposed to be part and parcel of the country to
 which they belong.  “But that’s a detail.  I talked to you of this
 business because it’s your government that grumbles most at our police.
 You see that we are not so bad.  I wanted particularly to tell you of our
 success.”
 
 “I’m sure I’m very grateful,” muttered Mr Vladimir through his teeth.
 
 “We can put our finger on every anarchist here,” went on the Assistant
 Commissioner, as though he were quoting Chief Inspector Heat.  “All
 that’s wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur to make
 everything safe.”
 
 Mr Vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom.
 
 “You’re not going in here,” remarked the Assistant Commissioner, looking
 at a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect, with the light
 of a great hall falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of
 steps.
 
 But Mr Vladimir, sitting, stony-eyed, inside the hansom, drove off
 without a word.
 
 The Assistant Commissioner himself did not turn into the noble building.
 It was the Explorers’ Club.  The thought passed through his mind that Mr
 Vladimir, honorary member, would not be seen very often there in the
 future.  He looked at his watch.  It was only half-past ten.  He had had
 a very full evening.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XI
 
 
 After Chief Inspector Heat had left him Mr Verloc moved about the
--**--**--
 seemed to hold him mainly by the throat.  He could not have swallowed
 anything solid.  Michaelis’ cottage was as destitute of provisions as the
 cell of a prisoner.  The ticket-of-leave apostle lived on a little milk
 and crusts of stale bread.  Moreover, when Mr Verloc arrived he had
 already gone upstairs after his frugal meal.  Absorbed in the toil and
 delight of literary composition, he had not even answered Mr Verloc’s
 shout up the little staircase.
 
 “I am taking this young fellow home for a day or two.”
 
 And, in truth, Mr Verloc did not wait for an answer, but had marched out
 of the cottage at once, followed by the obedient Stevie.
 
 Now that all action was over and his fate taken out of his hands with
 unexpected swiftness, Mr Verloc felt terribly empty physically.  He
 carved the meat, cut the bread, and devoured his supper standing by the
 table, and now and then casting a glance towards his wife.  Her prolonged
 immobility disturbed the comfort of his refection.  He walked again into
 the shop, and came up very close to her.  This sorrow with a veiled face
 made Mr Verloc uneasy.  He expected, of course, his wife to be very much
 upset, but he wanted her to pull herself together.  He needed all her
 assistance and all her loyalty in these new conjunctures his fatalism had
 already accepted.
 
 “Can’t be helped,” he said in a tone of gloomy sympathy.  “Come, Winnie,
 we’ve got to think of to-morrow.  You’ll want all your wits about you
 after I am taken away.”
 
 He paused.  Mrs Verloc’s breast heaved convulsively.  This was not
 reassuring to Mr Verloc, in whose view the newly created situation
 required from the two people most concerned in it calmness, decision, and
 other qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate
--**--**--
 looked at him.
 
 It all had the appearance of a struggle for the possession of a chair,
 because Mr Verloc instantly took his wife’s place in it.  Mr Verloc did
 not cover his face with his hands, but a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his
 features.  A term of imprisonment could not be avoided.  He did not wish
 now to avoid it.  A prison was a place as safe from certain unlawful
 vengeances as the grave, with this advantage, that in a prison there is
 room for hope.  What he saw before him was a term of imprisonment, an
 early release and then life abroad somewhere, such as he had contemplated
 already, in case of failure.  Well, it was a failure, if not exactly the
 sort of failure he had feared.  It had been so near success that he could
 have positively terrified Mr Vladimir out of his ferocious scoffing with
 this proof of occult efficiency.  So at least it seemed now to Mr Verloc.
 His prestige with the Embassy would have been immense if—if his wife had
 not had the unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside Stevie’s
 overcoat.  Mr Verloc, who was no fool, had soon perceived the
 extraordinary character of the influence he had over Stevie, though he
 did not understand exactly its origin—the doctrine of his supreme wisdom
 and goodness inculcated by two anxious women.  In all the eventualities
 he had foreseen Mr Verloc had calculated with correct insight on Stevie’s
 instinctive loyalty and blind discretion.  The eventuality he had not
 foreseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond husband.  From every
 other point of view it was rather advantageous.  Nothing can equal the
 everlasting discretion of death.  Mr Verloc, sitting perplexed and
 frightened in the small parlour of the Cheshire Cheese, could not help
--**--**--
 understand why—don’t you?”
 
 He blinked at his wife knowingly.
 
 “No,” said Mrs Verloc in an unresonant voice, and without looking at him
 at all.  “What are you talking about?”
 
 A great discouragement, the result of fatigue, came upon Mr Verloc.  He
 had had a very full day, and his nerves had been tried to the utmost.
 After a month of maddening worry, ending in an unexpected catastrophe,
 the storm-tossed spirit of Mr Verloc longed for repose.  His career as a
 secret agent had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen;
 only, now, perhaps he could manage to get a night’s sleep at last.  But
 looking at his wife, he doubted it.  She was taking it very hard—not at
 all like herself, he thought.  He made an effort to speak.
 
 “You’ll have to pull yourself together, my girl,” he said
 sympathetically.  “What’s done can’t be undone.”
 
 Mrs Verloc gave a slight start, though not a muscle of her white face
 moved in the least.  Mr Verloc, who was not looking at her, continued
 ponderously.
 
 “You go to bed now.  What you want is a good cry.”
 
 This opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general consent of
 mankind.  It is universally understood that, as if it were nothing more
 substantial than vapour floating in the sky, every emotion of a woman is
 bound to end in a shower.  And it is very probable that had Stevie died
 in his bed under her despairing gaze, in her protecting arms, Mrs
 Verloc’s grief would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure
 tears.  Mrs Verloc, in common with other human beings, was provided with
 a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal
 manifestation of human destiny.  Without “troubling her head about it,”
--**--**--
 
 The silence in the kitchen was prolonged, and Mr Verloc felt
 disappointed.  He had expected his wife to say something.  But Mrs
 Verloc’s lips, composed in their usual form, preserved a statuesque
 immobility like the rest of her face.  And Mr Verloc was disappointed.
 Yet the occasion did not, he recognised, demand speech from her.  She was
 a woman of very few words.  For reasons involved in the very foundation
 of his psychology, Mr Verloc was inclined to put his trust in any woman
 who had given herself to him.  Therefore he trusted his wife.  Their
 accord was perfect, but it was not precise.  It was a tacit accord,
 congenial to Mrs Verloc’s incuriosity and to Mr Verloc’s habits of mind,
 which were indolent and secret.  They refrained from going to the bottom
 of facts and motives.
 
 This reserve, expressing, in a way, their profound confidence in each
 other, introduced at the same time a certain element of vagueness into
 their intimacy.  No system of conjugal relations is perfect.  Mr Verloc
 presumed that his wife had understood him, but he would have been glad to
 hear her say what she thought at the moment.  It would have been a
 comfort.
 
 There were several reasons why this comfort was denied him.  There was a
 physical obstacle: Mrs Verloc had no sufficient command over her voice.
 She did not see any alternative between screaming and silence, and
 instinctively she chose the silence.  Winnie Verloc was temperamentally a
 silent person.  And there was the paralysing atrocity of the thought
 which occupied her.  Her cheeks were blanched, her lips ashy, her
 immobility amazing.  And she thought without looking at Mr Verloc: “This
 man took the boy away to murder him.  He took the boy away from his home
 to murder him.  He took the boy away from me to murder him!”
--**--**--
 about it,” continued Mr Verloc magnanimously.  “You couldn’t know.”
 
 “I couldn’t,” breathed out Mrs Verloc.  It was as if a corpse had spoken.
 Mr Verloc took up the thread of his discourse.
 
 “I don’t blame you.  I’ll make them sit up.  Once under lock and key it
 will be safe enough for me to talk—you understand.  You must reckon on me
 being two years away from you,” he continued, in a tone of sincere
 concern.  “It will be easier for you than for me.  You’ll have something
 to do, while I—Look here, Winnie, what you must do is to keep this
 business going for two years.  You know enough for that.  You’ve a good
 head on you.  I’ll send you word when it’s time to go about trying to
 sell.  You’ll have to be extra careful.  The comrades will be keeping an
 eye on you all the time.  You’ll have to be as artful as you know how,
 and as close as the grave.  No one must know what you are going to do.  I
 have no mind to get a knock on the head or a stab in the back directly I
 am let out.”
 
 Thus spoke Mr Verloc, applying his mind with ingenuity and forethought to
 the problems of the future.  His voice was sombre, because he had a
 correct sentiment of the situation.  Everything which he did not wish to
 pass had come to pass.  The future had become precarious.  His judgment,
 perhaps, had been momentarily obscured by his dread of Mr Vladimir’s
 truculent folly.  A man somewhat over forty may be excusably thrown into
 considerable disorder by the prospect of losing his employment,
 especially if the man is a secret agent of political police, dwelling
 secure in the consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high
--**--**--
 Verloc.  There was no need for her now to stay there, in that kitchen, in
 that house, with that man—since the boy was gone for ever.  No need
 whatever.  And on that Mrs Verloc rose as if raised by a spring.  But
 neither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all.
 And this inability arrested her.  Mr Verloc watched her with marital
 solicitude.
 
 “You’re looking more like yourself,” he said uneasily.  Something
 peculiar in the blackness of his wife’s eyes disturbed his optimism.  At
 that precise moment Mrs Verloc began to look upon herself as released
 from all earthly ties.
 
 She had her freedom.  Her contract with existence, as represented by that
 man standing over there, was at an end.  She was a free woman.  Had this
 view become in some way perceptible to Mr Verloc he would have been
 extremely shocked.  In his affairs of the heart Mr Verloc had been always
 carelessly generous, yet always with no other idea than that of being
 loved for himself.  Upon this matter, his ethical notions being in
 agreement with his vanity, he was completely incorrigible.  That this
 should be so in the case of his virtuous and legal connection he was
 perfectly certain.  He had grown older, fatter, heavier, in the belief
 that he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own sake.  When he
 saw Mrs Verloc starting to walk out of the kitchen without a word he was
 disappointed.
 
 “Where are you going to?” he called out rather sharply.  “Upstairs?”
 
 Mrs Verloc in the doorway turned at the voice.  An instinct of prudence
 born of fear, the excessive fear of being approached and touched by that
 man, induced her to nod at him slightly (from the height of two steps),
 with a stir of the lips which the conjugal optimism of Mr Verloc took for
