 young fellow looked charming in his sleep. A temperance lecturer saw
 him, and wrought poor David into the texture of his evening's
 discourse as an awful instance of dead drunkenness by the roadside.
 
 But censure, praise, merriment, scorn and indifference were all
 one--or, rather, all nothing--to David Swan. He had slept only a few
 moments when a brown carriage drawn by a handsome pair of horses
 bowled easily along and was brought to a standstill nearly in front of
 David's resting-place. A linch-pin had fallen out and permitted one of
 the wheels to slide off. The damage was slight and occasioned merely a
 momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife, who were
 returning to Boston in the carriage. While the coachman and a servant
 were replacing the wheel the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves
 beneath the maple trees, and there espied the bubbling fountain and
 David Swan asleep beside it. Impressed with the awe which the humblest
 sleeper usually sheds around him, the merchant trod as lightly as the
 gout would allow, and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk
 gown lest David should start up all of a sudden.
 
 "How soundly he sleeps!" whispered the old gentleman. "From what a
 depth he draws that easy breath! Such sleep as that, brought on
 without an opiate, would be worth more to me than half my income, for
 it would suppose health and an untroubled mind."
 
 "And youth besides," said the lady. "Healthy and quiet age does not
 sleep thus. Our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness."
 
 The longer they looked, the more did this elderly couple feel
 interested in the unknown youth to whom the wayside and the maple
 shade were as a secret chamber with the rich gloom of damask curtains
--**--**--
 much as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude. He
 knew not that a phantom of Wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its
 waters, nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their murmur, nor
 that one of Death had threatened to crimson them with his blood, all
 in the brief hour since he lay down to sleep. Sleeping or waking, we
 hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen.
 Does it not argue a superintending Providence that, while viewless and
 unexpected events thrust themselves continually athwart our path,
 there should still be regularity enough in mortal life to render
 foresight even partially available?
 
 
 
 
 SIGHTS FROM A STEEPLE.
 
 
 So! I have climbed high, and my reward is small. Here I stand with
 wearied knees--earth, indeed, at a dizzy depth below, but heaven far,
 far beyond me still. Oh that I could soar up into the very zenith,
 where man never breathed nor eagle ever flew, and where the ethereal
 azure melts away from the eye and appears only a deepened shade of
 nothingness! And yet I shiver at that cold and solitary thought. What
 clouds are gathering in the golden west with direful intent against
 the brightness and the warmth of this summer afternoon? They are
 ponderous air-ships, black as death and freighted with the tempest,
 and at intervals their thunder--the signal-guns of that unearthly
 squadron--rolls distant along the deep of heaven. These nearer heaps
 of fleecy vapor--methinks I could roll and toss upon them the whole
 day long--seem scattered here and there for the repose of tired
 pilgrims through the sky. Perhaps--for who can tell?--beautiful
 spirits are disporting themselves there, and will bless my mortal eye
 with the brief appearance of their curly locks of golden light and
 laughing faces fair and faint as the people of a rosy dream. Or where
--**--**--
 The clouds within a little time have gathered over all the sky,
 hanging heavily, as if about to drop in one unbroken mass upon the
 earth. At intervals the lightning flashes from their brooding hearts,
 quivers, disappears, and then comes the thunder, travelling slowly
 after its twin-born flame. A strong wind has sprung up, howls through
 the darkened streets, and raises the dust in dense bodies to rebel
 against the approaching storm. The disbanded soldiers fly, the funeral
 has already vanished like its dead, and all people hurry homeward--all
 that have a home--while a few lounge by the corners or trudge on
 desperately at their leisure. In a narrow lane which communicates with
 the shady street I discern the rich old merchant putting himself to
 the top of his speed lest the rain should convert his hair-powder to a
 paste. Unhappy gentleman! By the slow vehemence and painful moderation
 wherewith he journeys, it is but too evident that Podagra has left its
 thrilling tenderness in his great toe. But yonder, at a far more rapid
 pace, come three other of my acquaintance, the two pretty girls and
 the young man unseasonably interrupted in their walk. Their footsteps
 are supported by the risen dust, the wind lends them its velocity,
 they fly like three sea-birds driven landward by the tempestuous
 breeze. The ladies would not thus rival Atalanta if they but knew that
 any one were at leisure to observe them. Ah! as they hasten onward,
 laughing in the angry face of nature, a sudden catastrophe has
 chanced. At the corner where the narrow lane enters into the street
 they come plump against the old merchant, whose tortoise-motion has
 just brought him to that point. He likes not the sweet encounter; the
 darkness of the whole air gathers speedily upon his visage, and there
--**--**--
 beside a pool of green and sluggish water at the bottom of the basin.
 Such scenes as this (so gray tradition tells) were once the resort of
 a power of evil and his plighted subjects, and here at midnight or on
 the dim verge of evening they were said to stand round the mantling
 pool disturbing its putrid waters in the performance of an impious
 baptismal rite. The chill beauty of an autumnal sunset was now gilding
 the three hill-tops, whence a paler tint stole down their sides into
 the hollow.
 
 "Here is our pleasant meeting come to pass," said the aged crone,
 "according as thou hast desired. Say quickly what thou wouldst have of
 me, for there is but a short hour that we may tarry here."
 
 As the old withered woman spoke a smile glimmered on her countenance
 like lamplight on the wall of a sepulchre. The lady trembled and cast
 her eyes upward to the verge of the basin, as if meditating to return
 with her purpose unaccomplished. But it was not so ordained.
 
 "I am stranger in this land, as you know," said she, at length.
 "Whence I come it matters not, but I have left those behind me with
 whom my fate was intimately bound, and from whom I am cut off for
 ever. There is a weight in my bosom that I cannot away with, and I
 have come hither to inquire of their welfare."
 
 "And who is there by this green pool that can bring thee news from the
 ends of the earth?" cried the old woman, peering into the lady's face.
 "Not from my lips mayst thou hear these tidings; yet be thou bold, and
 the daylight shall not pass away from yonder hilltop before thy wish
 be granted."
 
 "I will do your bidding though I die," replied the lady, desperately.
--**--**--
 
 "And did you also hear them?" exclaimed she, a sense of intolerable
 humiliation triumphing over her agony and fear.
 
 "Yea, and we have yet more to hear," replied the old woman, "wherefore
 cover thy face quickly."
 
 Again the withered hag poured forth the monotonous words of a prayer
 that was not meant to be acceptable in heaven, and soon in the pauses
 of her breath strange murmurings began to thicken, gradually
 increasing, so as to drown and overpower the charm by which they grew.
 Shrieks pierced through the obscurity of sound and were succeeded by
 the singing of sweet female voices, which in their turn gave way to a
 wild roar of laughter broken suddenly by groanings and sobs, forming
 altogether a ghastly confusion of terror and mourning and mirth.
 Chains were rattling, fierce and stern voices uttered threats and the
 scourge resounded at their command. All these noises deepened and
 became substantial to the listener's ear, till she could distinguish
 every soft and dreamy accent of the love-songs that died causelessly
 into funeral-hymns. She shuddered at the unprovoked wrath which blazed
 up like the spontaneous kindling of flume, and she grew faint at the
 fearful merriment raging miserably around her. In the midst of this
 wild scene, where unbound passions jostled each other in a drunken
 career, there was one solemn voice of a man, and a manly and melodious
 voice it might once have been. He went to and fro continually, and his
 feet sounded upon the floor. In each member of that frenzied company
 whose own burning thoughts had become their exclusive world he sought
 an auditor for the story of his individual wrong, and interpreted
 their laughter and tears as his reward of scorn or pity. He spoke of
 woman's perfidy, of a wife who had broken her holiest vows, of a home
--**--**--
 hollow between three hills. But when the old woman stirred the
 kneeling lady, she lifted not her head.
 
 "Here has been a sweet hour's sport!" said the withered crone,
 chuckling to herself.
 
 
 
 
 THE TOLL-GATHERER'S DAY.
 
 A SKETCH OF TRANSITORY LIFE.
 
 
 Methinks, for a person whose instinct bids him rather to pore over the
 current of life than to plunge into its tumultuous waves, no
 undesirable retreat were a toll-house beside some thronged
 thoroughfare of the land. In youth, perhaps, it is good for the
 observer to run about the earth, to leave the track of his footsteps
 far and wide, to mingle himself with the action of numberless
 vicissitudes, and, finally, in some calm solitude to feed a musing
 spirit on all that he has seen and felt. But there are natures too
 indolent or too sensitive to endure the dust, the sunshine or the
 rain, the turmoil of moral and physical elements, to which all the
 wayfarers of the world expose themselves. For such a man how pleasant
 a miracle could life be made to roll its variegated length by the
 threshold of his own hermitage, and the great globe, as it were,
 perform its revolutions and shift its thousand scenes before his eyes
 without whirling him onward in its course! If any mortal be favored
 with a lot analogous to this, it is the toll-gatherer. So, at least,
 have I often fancied while lounging on a bench at the door of a small
 square edifice which stands between shore and shore in the midst of a
 long bridge. Beneath the timbers ebbs and flows an arm of the sea,
 while above, like the life-blood through a great artery, the travel of
 the north and east is continually throbbing. Sitting on the aforesaid
 bench, I amuse myself with a conception, illustrated by numerous
--**--**--
 and carpet-bags, and beneath the axle swings a leathern trunk dusty
 with yesterday's journey. Next appears a four-wheeled carryall peopled
 with a round half dozen of pretty girls, all drawn by a single horse
 and driven by a single gentleman. Luckless wight doomed through a
 whole summer day to be the butt of mirth and mischief among the
 frolicsome maidens! Bolt upright in a sulky rides a thin, sour-visaged
 man who as he pays his toll hands the toll-gatherer a printed card to
 stick upon the wall. The vinegar-faced traveller proves to be a
 manufacturer of pickles. Now paces slowly from timber to timber a
 horseman clad in black, with a meditative brow, as of one who,
 whithersoever his steed might bear him, would still journey through a
 mist of brooding thought. He is a country preacher going to labor at a
 protracted meeting. The next object passing townward is a butcher's
 cart canopied with its arch of snow-white cotton. Behind comes a
 "sauceman" driving a wagon full of new potatoes, green ears of corn,
 beets, carrots, turnips and summer squashes, and next two wrinkled,
 withered witch-looking old gossips in an antediluvian chaise drawn by
 a horse of former generations and going to peddle out a lot of
 huckleberries. See, there, a man trundling a wheelbarrow-load of
 lobsters. And now a milk-cart rattles briskly onward, covered with
 green canvas and conveying the contributions of a whole herd of cows,
 in large tin canisters.
 
 But let all these pay their toll and pass. Here comes a spectacle that
 causes the old toll-gatherer to smile benignantly, as if the
 travellers brought sunshine with them and lavished its gladsome
 influence all along the road. It is a barouche of the newest style,
 the varnished panels of which reflect the whole moving panorama of the
--**--**--
 been, I bent forward, and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery
 mirror. They were the reflection of my own. I looked again, and, lo!
 another face, deeper in the fountain than my own image, more distinct
 in all the features, yet faint as thought. The vision had the aspect
 of a fair young girl with locks of paly gold. A mirthful expression
 laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance,
 till it seemed just what a fountain would be if, while dancing merrily
 into the sunshine, it should assume the shape of woman. Through the
 dim rosiness of the cheeks I could see the brown leaves, the slimy
 twigs, the acorns and the sparkling sand. The solitary sunbeam was
 diffused among the golden hair, which melted into its faint brightness
 and became a glory round that head so beautiful.
 
 My description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus
 tenanted and how soon it was left desolate. I breathed, and there was
 the face; I held my breath, and it was gone. Had it passed away or
 faded into nothing? I doubted whether it had ever been.
 
 My sweet readers, what a dreamy and delicious hour did I spend where
 that vision found and left me! For a long time I sat perfectly still,
 waiting till it should reappear, and fearful that the slightest
 motion, or even the flutter of my breath, might frighten it away. Thus
 have I often started from a pleasant dream, and then kept quiet in
 hopes to wile it back. Deep were my musings as to the race and
 attributes of that ethereal being. Had I created her? Was she the
 daughter of my fancy, akin to those strange shapes which peep under
 the lids of children's eyes? And did her beauty gladden me for that
--**--**--
 luxurious arm-chair with his feet beneath a richly-carved mahogany
 table. Some old people have a dread of solitude, and when better
 company may not be had rejoice even to hear the quiet breathing of a
 babe asleep upon the carpet. But Mr. Smith, whose silver hair was the
 bright symbol of a life unstained except by such spots as are
 inseparable from human nature--he had no need of a babe to protect him
 by its purity, nor of a grown person to stand between him and his own
 soul. Nevertheless, either manhood must converse with age, or
 womanhood must soothe him with gentle cares, or infancy must sport
 around his chair, or his thoughts will stray into the misty region of
 the past and the old man be chill and sad. Wine will not always cheer
 him.
 
 Such might have been the case with Mr. Smith, when, through the
 brilliant medium of his glass of old Madeira, he beheld three figures
 entering the room. These were Fancy, who had assumed the garb and
 aspect of an itinerant showman, with a box of pictures on her back;
 and Memory, in the likeness of a clerk, with a pen behind her ear, an
 inkhorn at her buttonhole and a huge manuscript volume beneath her
 arm; and lastly, behind the other two, a person shrouded in a dusky
 mantle which concealed both face and form. But Mr. Smith had a shrewd
 idea that it was Conscience. How kind of Fancy, Memory and Conscience
 to visit the old gentleman just as he was beginning to imagine that
 the wine had neither so bright a sparkle nor so excellent a flavor as
 when himself and the liquor were less aged! Through the dim length of
 the apartment, where crimson curtains muffled the glare of sunshine
--**--**--
 diffused about his thoughts; in a dream, as it were, he strikes the
 death-blow into his victim's heart and starts to find an indelible
 blood-stain on his hand. Thus a novel-writer or a dramatist, in
 creating a villain of romance and fitting him with evil deeds, and the
 villain of actual life in projecting crimes that will be perpetrated,
 may almost meet each other halfway between reality and fancy. It is
 not until the crime is accomplished that Guilt clenches its gripe upon
 the guilty heart and claims it for his own. Then, and not before, sin
 is actually felt and acknowledged, and, if unaccompanied by repentance,
 grows a thousandfold more virulent by its self-consciousness. Be it
 considered, also, that men often overestimate their capacity for evil.
 At a distance, while its attendant circumstances do not press upon
 their notice and its results are dimly seen, they can bear to
 contemplate it. They may take the steps which lead to crime, impelled
 by the same sort of mental action as in working out a mathematical
 problem, yet be powerless with compunction at the final moment. They
 knew not what deed it was that they deemed themselves resolved to do.
 In truth, there is no such thing in man's nature as a settled and full
 resolve, either for good or evil, except at the very moment of
 execution. Let us hope, therefore, that all the dreadful consequences
 of sin will not be incurred unless the act have set its seal upon the
 thought.
 
 Yet, with the slight fancy-work which we have framed, some sad and
 awful truths are interwoven. Man must not disclaim his brotherhood
 even with the guiltiest, since, though his hand be clean, his heart
 has surely been polluted by the flitting phantoms of iniquity. He must
 feel that when he shall knock at the gate of heaven no semblance of an
--**--**--
 draw up a few general rules for your guidance in passing a second time
 through the perils of youth. Think what a sin and shame it would be
 if, with your peculiar advantages, you should not become patterns of
 virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age!"
 
 The doctor's four venerable friends made him no answer except by a
 feeble and tremulous laugh, so very ridiculous was the idea that,
 knowing how closely Repentance treads behind the steps of Error, they
 should ever go astray again.
 
 "Drink, then," said the doctor, bowing; "I rejoice that I have so well
 selected the subjects of my experiment."
 
 With palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips. The liquor,
 if it really possessed such virtues as Dr. Heidegger imputed to it,
 could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more
 woefully. They looked as if they had never known what youth or
 pleasure was, but had been the offspring of Nature's dotage, and
 always the gray, decrepit, sapless, miserable creatures who now sat
 stooping round the doctor's table without life enough in their souls
 or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again.
 They drank off the water and replaced their glasses on the table.
 
 Assuredly, there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of
 the party--not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of
 generous wine--together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine,
 brightening over all their visages at once. There was a healthful
 suffusion on their cheeks instead of the ashen hue that had made them
 look so corpse-like. They gazed at one another, and fancied that some
 magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad
 inscriptions which Father Time had been so long engraving on their
--**--**--
 While he spoke the butterfly fluttered down from the doctor's snowy
 head and fell upon the floor. His guests shivered again. A strange
 dullness--whether of the body or spirit they could not tell--was
 creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and
 fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm and left a
 deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had
 the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were
 they now four aged people sitting with their old friend Dr. Heidegger?
 
 "Are we grown old again so soon?" cried they, dolefully.
 
 In truth, they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more
 transient than that of wine; the delirium which it created had
 effervesced away. Yes, they were old again. With a shuddering impulse
 that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands
 before her face and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it
 could be no longer beautiful.
 
 "Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and, lo! the
 Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not;
 for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to
 bathe my lips in it--no, though its delirium were for years instead of
 moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me."
 
 But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves.
 They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida and quaff at
 morning, noon and night from the Fountain of Youth.

 HOWE'S MASQUERADE.
 
 
 One afternoon last summer, while walking along Washington street, my
 eye was attracted by a sign-board protruding over a narrow archway
--**--**--
 carved balustrade, freshly painted in the lower stories, but growing
 dingier as we ascend, borders the staircase with its quaintly twisted
 and intertwined pillars, from top to bottom. Up these stairs the
 military boots, or perchance the gouty shoes, of many a governor have
 trodden as the wearers mounted to the cupola which afforded them so
 wide a view over their metropolis and the surrounding country. The
 cupola is an octagon with several windows, and a door opening upon the
 roof. From this station, as I pleased myself with imagining, Gage may
 have beheld his disastrous victory on Bunker Hill (unless one of the
 tri-mountains intervened), and Howe have marked the approaches of
 Washington's besieging army, although the buildings since erected in
 the vicinity have shut out almost every object save the steeple of the
 Old South, which seems almost within arm's length. Descending from the
 cupola, I paused in the garret to observe the ponderous white-oak
 framework, so much more massive than the frames of modern houses, and
 thereby resembling an antique skeleton. The brick walls, the materials
 of which were imported from Holland, and the timbers of the mansion,
 are still as sound as ever, but, the floors and other interior parts
 being greatly decayed, it is contemplated to gut the whole and build a
 new house within the ancient frame-and brickwork. Among other
 inconveniences of the present edifice, mine host mentioned that any
 jar or motion was apt to shake down the dust of ages out of the
 ceiling of one chamber upon the floor of that beneath it.
 
 We stepped forth from the great front window into the balcony where in
 old times it was doubtless the custom of the king's representative to
 show himself to a loyal populace, requiting their huzzas and tossed-up
 hats with stately bendings of his dignified person. In those days the
--**--**--
 "In the devil's name, what is this?" muttered Sir William Howe to a
 gentleman beside him. "A procession of the regicide judges of King
 Charles the martyr?"
 
 "These," said Colonel Joliffe, breaking silence almost for the first
 time that evening--"these, if I interpret them aright, are the
 Puritan governors, the rulers of the old original democracy of
 Massachusetts--Endicott with the banner from which he had torn the
 symbol of subjection, and Winthrop and Sir Henry Vane and Dudley,
 Haynes, Bellingham and Leverett."
 
 "Why had that young man a stain of blood upon his ruff?" asked Miss
 Joliffe.
 
 "Because in after-years," answered her grandfather, "he laid down the
 wisest head in England upon the block for the principles of liberty."
 
 "Will not Your Excellency order out the guard?" whispered Lord Percy,
 who, with other British officers, had now assembled round the general.
 "There may be a plot under this mummery."
 
 "Tush! we have nothing to fear," carelessly replied Sir William Howe.
 "There can be no worse treason in the matter than a jest, and that
 somewhat of the dullest. Even were it a sharp and bitter one, our best
 policy would be to laugh it off. See! here come more of these gentry."
 
 Another group of characters had now partly descended the staircase.
 The first was a venerable and white-bearded patriarch who cautiously
 felt his way downward with a staff. Treading hastily behind him, and
 stretching forth his gauntleted hand as if to grasp the old man's
 shoulder, came a tall soldier-like figure equipped with a plumed cap
 of steel, a bright breastplate and a long sword, which rattled against
 the stairs. Next was seen a stout man dressed in rich and courtly
 attire, but not of courtly demeanor; his gait had the swinging motion
 of a seaman's walk, and, chancing to stumble on the staircase, he
--**--**--
 wondrous tale that on the anniversary night of Britain's discomfiture
 the ghosts of the ancient governors of Massachusetts still glide
 through the portal of the Province House. And last of all comes a
 figure shrouded in a military cloak, tossing his clenched hands into
 the air and stamping his iron-shod boots upon the broad freestone
 steps with a semblance of feverish despair, but without the sound of a
 foot-tramp.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 When the truth-telling accents of the elderly gentleman were hushed, I
 drew a long breath and looked round the room, striving with the best
 energy of my imagination to throw a tinge of romance and historic
 grandeur over the realities of the scene. But my nostrils snuffed up a
 scent of cigar-smoke, clouds of which the narrator had emitted by way
 of visible emblem, I suppose, of the nebulous obscurity of his tale.
 Moreover, my gorgeous fantasies were woefully disturbed by the
 rattling of the spoon in a tumbler of whiskey-punch which Mr. Thomas
 Waite was mingling for a customer. Nor did it add to the picturesque
 appearance of the panelled walls that the slate of the Brookline stage
 was suspended against them, instead of the armorial escutcheon of some
 far-descended governor. A stage-driver sat at one of the windows
 reading a penny paper of the day--the Boston _Times_--and presenting a
 figure which could nowise be brought into any picture of "Times in
 Boston" seventy or a hundred years ago. On the window-seat lay a
 bundle neatly done up in brown paper, the direction of which I had the
 idle curiosity to read: "MISS SUSAN HUGGINS, at the PROVINCE HOUSE." A
 pretty chambermaid, no doubt. In truth, it is desperately hard work
 when we attempt to throw the spell of hoar antiquity over localities
 with which the living world and the day that is passing over us have
--**--**--
 
 In one of the apartments of the province-house there was long
 preserved an ancient picture the frame of which was as black as ebony,
 and the canvas itself so dark with age, damp and smoke that not a
 touch of the painter's art could be discerned. Time had thrown an
 impenetrable veil over it and left to tradition and fable and
 conjecture to say what had once been there portrayed. During the rule
 of many successive governors it had hung, by prescriptive and
 undisputed right, over the mantel piece of the same chamber, and it
 still kept its place when Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson assumed the
 administration of the province on the departure of Sir Francis
 Bernard.
 
 The lieutenant-governor sat one afternoon resting his head against the
 carved back of his stately arm-chair and gazing up thoughtfully at the
 void blackness of the picture. It was scarcely a time for such
 inactive musing, when affairs of the deepest moment required the
 ruler's decision; for within that very hour Hutchinson had received
 intelligence of the arrival of a British fleet bringing three
 regiments from Halifax to overawe the insubordination of the people.
 These troops awaited his permission to occupy the fortress of Castle
 William and the town itself, yet, instead of affixing his signature to
 an official order, there sat the lieutenant-governor so carefully
 scrutinizing the black waste of canvas that his demeanor attracted the
 notice of two young persons who attended him. One, wearing a military
 dress of buff, was his kinsman, Francis Lincoln, the provincial
 captain of Castle William; the other, who sat on a low stool beside
 his chair, was Alice Vane, his favorite niece. She was clad entirely
 in white--a pale, ethereal creature who, though a native of New
 England, had been educated abroad and seemed not merely a stranger
--**--**--
 Castle William fancied that the girl's air and mien were such as might
 have belonged to one of those spirits of fable--fairies or creatures
 of a more antique mythology--who sometimes mingled their agency with
 mortal affairs, half in caprice, yet with a sensibility to human weal
 or woe. As he held the door for her to pass Alice beckoned to the
 picture and smiled.
 
 "Come forth, dark and evil shape!" cried she. "It is thine hour."
 
 In the evening Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson sat in the same chamber
 where the foregoing scene had occurred, surrounded by several persons
 whose various interests had summoned them together. There were the
 selectmen of Boston--plain patriarchal fathers of the people,
 excellent representatives of the old puritanical founders whose sombre
 strength had stamped so deep an impress upon the New England
 character. Contrasting with these were one or two members of council,
 richly dressed in the white wigs, the embroidered waistcoats and other
 magnificence of the time, and making a somewhat ostentatious display
 of courtier-like ceremonial. In attendance, likewise, was a major of
 the British army, awaiting the lieutenant-governor's orders for the
 landing of the troops, which still remained on board the transports.
 The captain of Castle William stood beside Hutchinson's chair, with
 folded arms, glancing rather haughtily at the British officer by whom
 he was soon to be superseded in his command. On a table in the centre
 of the chamber stood a branched silver candlestick, throwing down the
 glow of half a dozen waxlights upon a paper apparently ready for the
 lieutenant-governor's signature.
 
 Partly shrouded in the voluminous folds of one of the window-curtains,
 which fell from the ceiling to the floor, was seen the white drapery
 of a lady's robe. It may appear strange that Alice Vane should have
 been there at such a time, but there was something so childlike, so
--**--**--
 been unobserved--that a black silk curtain was suspended before the
 mysterious picture, so as completely to conceal it. His thoughts
 immediately recurred to the scene of the preceding afternoon, and in
 his surprise, confused by indistinct emotions, yet sensible that his
 niece must have had an agency in this phenomenon, he called loudly
 upon her:
 
 "Alice! Come hither, Alice!"
 
 No sooner had he spoken than Alice Vane glided from her station, and,
 pressing one hand across her eyes, with the other snatched away the
 sable curtain that concealed the portrait. An exclamation of surprise
 burst from every beholder, but the lieutenant-governor's voice had a
 tone of horror.
 
 "By Heaven!" said he, in a low inward murmur, speaking rather to
 himself than to those around him; "if the spirit of Edward Randolph
 were to appear among us from the place of torment, he could not wear
 more of the terrors of hell upon his face."
 
 "For some wise end," said the aged selectman, solemnly, "hath
 Providence scattered away the mist of years that had so long hid this
 dreadful effigy. Until this hour no living man hath seen what we
 behold."
 
 Within the antique frame which so recently had enclosed a sable waste
 of canvas now appeared a visible picture-still dark, indeed, in its
 hues and shadings, but thrown forward in strong relief. It was a
 half-length figure of a gentleman in a rich but very old-fashioned
 dress of embroidered velvet, with a broad ruff and a beard, and
 wearing a hat the brim of which overshadowed his forehead. Beneath
 this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare which was almost lifelike.
 The whole portrait started so distinctly out of the background that it
 had the effect of a person looking down from the wall at the
 astonished and awe-stricken spectators. The expression of the face, if
--**--**--
 trembled at the recollection of the scene, as if an evil spirit had
 appeared visibly among them. And, as for Hutchinson, when, far over
 the ocean, his dying-hour drew on, he gasped for breath and complained
 that he was choking with the blood of the Boston Massacre, and Francis
 Lincoln, the former captain of Castle William, who was standing at his
 bedside, perceived a likeness in his frenzied look to that of Edward
 Randolph. Did his broken spirit feel at that dread hour the tremendous
 burden of a people's curse?
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 At the conclusion of this miraculous legend I inquired of mine host
 whether the picture still remained in the chamber over our heads, but
 Mr. Tiffany informed me that it had long since been removed, and was
 supposed to be hidden in some out-of-the-way corner of the New England
 Museum. Perchance some curious antiquary may light upon it there, and,
 with the assistance of Mr. Howorth, the picture-cleaner, may supply a
 not unnecessary proof of the authenticity of the facts here set down.
 
 During the progress of the story a storm had been gathering abroad and
 raging and rattling so loudly in the upper regions of the Province
 House that it seemed as if all the old governors and great men were
 running riot above stairs while Mr. Bela Tiffany babbled of them
 below. In the course of generations, when many people have lived and
 died in an ancient house, the whistling of the wind through its
 crannies and the creaking of its beams and rafters become strangely
 like the tones of the human voice, or thundering laughter, or heavy
 footsteps treading the deserted chambers. It is as if the echoes of
 half a century were revived. Such were the ghostly sounds that roared
--**--**--
 its aristocratic front from Washington street. It may be unadvisable,
 however, to speak too loudly of the increased custom of the house,
 lest Mr. Waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so
 favorable terms as heretofore.
 
 Being thus welcomed as benefactors, neither Mr. Tiffany nor myself
 felt any scruple in doing full justice to the good things that were
 set before us. If the feast were less magnificent than those same
 panelled walls had witnessed in a bygone century; if mine host
 presided with somewhat less of state than might have befitted a
 successor of the royal governors; if the guests made a less imposing
 show than the bewigged and powdered and embroidered dignitaries who
 erst banqueted at the gubernatorial table and now sleep within their
 armorial tombs on Copp's Hill or round King's Chapel,--yet never, I
 may boldly say, did a more comfortable little party assemble in the
 province-house from Queen Anne's days to the Revolution. The occasion
 was rendered more interesting by the presence of a venerable personage
 whose own actual reminiscences went back to the epoch of Gage and
 Howe, and even supplied him with a doubtful anecdote or two of
 Hutchinson. He was one of that small, and now all but extinguished,
 class whose attachment to royalty, and to the colonial institutions
 and customs that were connected with it, had never yielded to the
 democratic heresies of after-times. The young queen of Britain has not
 a more loyal subject in her realm--perhaps not one who would kneel
 before her throne with such reverential love--as this old grandsire
 whose head has whitened beneath the mild sway of the republic which
 still in his mellower moments he terms a usurpation. Yet prejudices so
 obstinate have not made him an ungentle or impracticable companion. If
--**--**--
 "A very great disrespect!" exclaimed Captain Langford, an English
 officer who had recently brought despatches to Governor Shute. "The
 funeral should have been deferred lest Lady Eleanore's spirits be
 affected by such a dismal welcome."
 
 "With your pardon, sir," replied Dr. Clarke, a physician and a famous
 champion of the popular party, "whatever the heralds may pretend, a
 dead beggar must have precedence of a living queen. King Death confers
 high privileges."
 
 These remarks-were interchanged while the speakers waited a passage
 through the crowd which had gathered on each side of the gateway,
 leaving an open avenue to the portal of the province-house. A black
 slave in livery now leaped from behind the coach and threw open the
 door, while at the same moment Governor Shute descended the flight of
 steps from his mansion to assist Lady Eleanore in alighting. But the
 governor's stately approach was anticipated in a manner that excited
 general astonishment. A pale young man with his black hair all in
 disorder rushed from the throng and prostrated himself beside the
 coach, thus offering his person as a footstool for Lady Eleanore
 Rochcliffe to tread upon. She held back an instant, yet with an
 expression as if doubting whether the young man were worthy to bear
 the weight of her footstep rather than dissatisfied to receive such
 awful reverence from a fellow-mortal.
 
 "Up, sir!" said the governor, sternly, at the same time lifting his
 cane over the intruder. "What means the Bedlamite by this freak?"
 
 "Nay," answered Lady Eleanore, playfully, but with more scorn than
 pity in her tone; "Your Excellency shall not strike him. When men seek
 only to be trampled upon, it were a pity to deny them a favor so
 easily granted--and so well deserved!" Then, though as lightly as a
 sunbeam on a cloud, she placed her foot upon the cowering form and
--**--**--
 embroidered mantle over her head in such a fashion as to give a
 completely new aspect to her beautiful face, which, half hidden, half
 revealed, seemed to belong to some being of mysterious character and
 purposes.
 
 "Farewell, Jervase Helwyse!" said she. "Keep my image in your
 remembrance as you behold it now."
 
 "Alas, lady!" he replied, in a tone no longer wild, but sad as a
 funeral-bell; "we must meet shortly when your face may wear another
 aspect, and that shall be the image that must abide within me." He
 made no more resistance to the violent efforts of the gentlemen and
 servants who almost dragged him out of the apartment and dismissed him
 roughly from the iron gate of the province-house.
 
 Captain Langford, who had been very active in this affair, was
 returning to the presence of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe, when he
 encountered the physician, Dr. Clarke, with whom he had held some
 casual talk on the day of her arrival. The doctor stood apart,
 separated from Lady Eleanore by the width of the room, but eying her
 with such keen sagacity that Captain Langford involuntarily gave him
 credit for the discovery of some deep secret.
 
 "You appear to be smitten, after all, with the charms of this queenly
 maiden," said he, hoping thus to draw forth the physician's hidden
 knowledge.
 
 "God forbid!" answered Dr. Clarke, with a grave smile; "and if you be
 wise, you will put up the same prayer for yourself. Woe to those who
 shall be smitten by this beautiful Lady Eleanore! But yonder stands
 the governor, and I have a word or two for his private ear.
 Good-night!" He accordingly advanced to Governor Shute and addressed
 him in so low a tone that none of the bystanders could catch a word of
 what he said, although the sudden change of His Excellency's hitherto
--**--**--
 whose sad profession had led him to the province-house, where he was
 an infrequent guest in more prosperous times.
 
 "Young man, what is your purpose?" demanded he.
 
 "I seek the Lady Eleanore," answered Jervase Helwyse, submissively.
 
 "All have fled from her," said the physician. "Why do you seek her
 now? I tell you, youth, her nurse fell death-stricken on the threshold
 of that fatal chamber. Know ye not that never came such a curse to our
 shores as this lovely Lady Eleanore, that her breath has filled the
 air with poison, that she has shaken pestilence and death upon the
 land from the folds of her accursed mantle?"
 
 "Let me look upon her," rejoined the mad youth, more wildly. "Let me
 behold her in her awful beauty, clad in the regal garments of the
 pestilence. She and Death sit on a throne together; let me kneel down
 before them."
 
 "Poor youth!" said Dr. Clarke, and, moved by a deep sense of human
 weakness, a smile of caustic humor curled his lip even then. "Wilt
 thou still worship the destroyer and surround her image with fantasies
 the more magnificent the more evil she has wrought? Thus man doth ever
 to his tyrants. Approach, then. Madness, as I have noted, has that
 good efficacy that it will guard you from contagion, and perhaps its
 own cure may be found in yonder chamber." Ascending another flight of
 stairs, he threw open a door and signed to Jervase Helwyse that he
 should enter.
 
 The poor lunatic, it seems probable, had cherished a delusion that his
 haughty mistress sat in state, unharmed herself by the pestilential
 influence which as by enchantment she scattered round about her. He
 dreamed, no doubt, that her beauty was not dimmed, but brightened into
 superhuman splendor. With such anticipations he stole reverentially to
--**--**--
 
 "Not so, if it please Your Excellency," answered the time-stricken
 woman. "This roof has sheltered me long; I will not pass from it until
 they bear me to the tomb of my forefathers. What other shelter is
 there for old Esther Dudley save the province-house or the grave?"
 
 "Now, Heaven forgive me!" said Sir William Howe to himself. "I was
 about to leave this wretched old creature to starve or beg.--Take
 this, good Mistress Dudley," he added, putting a purse into her hands.
 "King George's head on these golden guineas is sterling yet, and will
 continue so, I warrant you, even should the rebels crown John Hancock
 their king. That purse will buy a better shelter than the
 province-house can now afford."
 
 "While the burden of life remains upon me I will have no other shelter
 than this roof," persisted Esther Dudley, striking her stuff upon the
 floor with a gesture that expressed immovable resolve; "and when Your
 Excellency returns in triumph, I will totter into the porch to welcome
 you."
 
 "My poor old friend!" answered the British general, and all his manly
 and martial pride could no longer restrain a gush of bitter tears.
 "This is an evil hour for you and me. The province which the king
 entrusted to my charge is lost. I go hence in misfortune--perchance in
 disgrace--to return no more. And you, whose present being is
 incorporated with the past, who have seen governor after governor in
 stately pageantry ascend these steps, whose whole life has been an
 observance of majestic ceremonies and a worship of the king,--how will
 you endure the change? Come with us; bid farewell to a land that has
 shaken off its allegiance, and live still under a royal government at
 Halifax."
 
 "Never! never!" said the pertinacious old dame. "Here will I abide,
--**--**--
 mansion, where Esther mingled with them as if she likewise were a
 shade. Without vouching for the truth of such traditions, it is
 certain that Mistress Dudley sometimes assembled a few of the stanch
 though crestfallen old Tories who had lingered in the rebel town
 during those days of wrath and tribulation. Out of a cobwebbed bottle
 containing liquor that a royal governor might have smacked his lips
 over they quaffed healths to the king and babbled treason to the
 republic, feeling as if the protecting shadow of the throne were still
 flung around them. But, draining the last drops of their liquor, they
 stole timorously homeward, and answered not again if the rude mob
 reviled them in the street.
 
 Yet Esther Dudley's most frequent and favored guests were the children
 of the town. Toward them she was never stern. A kindly and loving
 nature hindered elsewhere from its free course by a thousand rocky
 prejudices lavished itself upon these little ones. By bribes of
 gingerbread of her own making, stamped with a royal crown, she tempted
 their sunny sportiveness beneath the gloomy portal of the
 province-house, and would often beguile them to spend a whole play-day
 there, sitting in a circle round the verge of her hoop-petticoat,
 greedily attentive to her stories of a dead world. And when these
 little boys and girls stole forth again from the dark, mysterious
 mansion, they went bewildered, full of old feelings that graver people
 had long ago forgotten, rubbing their eyes at the world around them as
 if they had gone astray into ancient times and become children of the
 past. At home, when their parents asked where they had loitered such a
 weary while and with whom they had been at play, the children would
 talk of all the departed worthies of the province as far back as
--**--**--
 woe. The moment of rising belongs to another period of time, and
 appears so distant that the plunge out of a warm bed into the frosty
 air cannot yet be anticipated with dismay. Yesterday has already
 vanished among the shadows of the past; to-morrow has not yet emerged
 from the future. You have found an intermediate space where the
 business of life does not intrude, where the passing moment lingers
 and becomes truly the present; a spot where Father Time, when he
 thinks nobody is watching him, sits down by the wayside to take
 breath. Oh that he would fall asleep and let mortals live on without
 growing older!
 
 Hitherto you have lain perfectly still, because the slightest motion
 would dissipate the fragments of your slumber. Now, being irrevocably
 awake, you peep through the half-drawn window-curtain, and observe
 that the glass is ornamented with fanciful devices in frost-work, and
 that each pane presents something like a frozen dream. There will be
 time enough to trace out the analogy while waiting the summons to
 breakfast. Seen through the clear portion of the glass where the
 silvery mountain-peaks of the frost-scenery do not ascend, the most
 conspicuous object is the steeple, the white spire of which directs
 you to the wintry lustre of the firmament. You may almost distinguish
 the figures on the clock that has just told the hour. Such a frosty
 sky and the snow-covered roofs and the long vista of the frozen
 street, all white, and the distant water hardened into rock, might
 make you shiver even under four blankets and a woollen comforter. Yet
 look at that one glorious star! Its beams are distinguishable from all
 the rest, and actually cast the shadow of the casement on the bed with
 a radiance of deeper hue than moonlight, though not so accurate an
--**--**--
 anywhere but in your haunted mind. At the same moment the slumbering
 embers on the hearth send forth a gleam which palely illuminates the
 whole outer room and flickers through the door of the bedchamber, but
 cannot quite dispel its obscurity. Your eye searches for whatever may
 remind you of the living world. With eager minuteness you take note of
 the table near the fireplace, the book with an ivory knife between its
 leaves, the unfolded letter, the hat and the fallen glove. Soon the
 flame vanishes, and with it the whole scene is gone, though its image
 remains an instant in your mind's eye when darkness has swallowed the
 reality. Throughout the chamber there is the same obscurity as before,
 but not the same gloom within your breast.
 
 As your head falls back upon the pillow you think--in a whisper be it
 spoken--how pleasant in these night solitudes would be the rise and
 fall of a softer breathing than your own, the slight pressure of a
 tenderer bosom, the quiet throb of a purer heart, imparting its
 peacefulness to your troubled one, as if the fond sleeper were
 involving you in her dream. Her influence is over you, though she have
 no existence but in that momentary image. You sink down in a flowery
 spot on the borders of sleep and wakefulness, while your thoughts rise
 before you in pictures, all disconnected, yet all assimilated by a
 pervading gladsomeness and beauty. The wheeling of gorgeous squadrons
 that glitter in the sun is succeeded by the merriment of children
 round the door of a schoolhouse beneath the glimmering shadow of old
 trees at the corner of a rustic lane. You stand in the sunny rain of a
 summer shower, and wander among the sunny trees of an autumnal wood,
--**--**--
 the ocean-foam and the crimson light, whose merry life was spent in
 dancing on the crests of the billows that threw up their spray to
 support your footsteps. As I drew nearer I fancied you akin to the
 race of mermaids, and thought how pleasant it would be to dwell with
 you among the quiet coves in the shadow of the cliffs, and to roam
 along secluded beaches of the purest sand, and, when our Northern
 shores grew bleak, to haunt the islands, green and lonely, far amid
 summer seas. And yet it gladdened me, after all this nonsense, to find
 you nothing but a pretty young girl sadly perplexed with the rude
 behavior of the wind about your petticoats. Thus I did with Susan as
 with most other things in my earlier days, dipping her image into my
 mind and coloring it of a thousand fantastic hues before I could see
 her as she really was.
 
 Now, Susan, for a sober picture of our village. It was a small
 collection of dwellings that seemed to have been cast up by the sea
 with the rock-weed and marine plants that it vomits after a storm, or
 to have come ashore among the pipe-staves and other lumber which had
 been washed from the deck of an Eastern schooner. There was just space
 for the narrow and sandy street between the beach in front and a
 precipitous hill that lifted its rocky forehead in the rear among a
 waste of juniper-bushes and the wild growth of a broken pasture. The
 village was picturesque in the variety of its edifices, though all
 were rude. Here stood a little old hovel, built, perhaps, of
 driftwood, there a row of boat-houses, and beyond them a two-story
 dwelling of dark and weatherbeaten aspect, the whole intermixed with
--**--**--
 warmth is grateful to my limbs, or by my own hearth when a friend or
 two are there, I overflow with talk, and yet am never tedious. With a
 broken voice I give utterance to much wisdom. Such, Heaven be praised!
 is the vigor of my faculties that many a forgotten usage, and
 traditions ancient in my youth, and early adventures of myself or
 others hitherto effaced by things more recent, acquire new
 distinctness in my memory. I remember the happy days when the haddock
 were more numerous on all the fishing-grounds than sculpins in the
 surf--when the deep-water cod swam close in-shore, and the dogfish,
 with his poisonous horn, had not learnt to take the hook. I can number
 every equinoctial storm in which the sea has overwhelmed the street,
 flooded the cellars of the village and hissed upon our kitchen hearth.
 I give the history of the great whale that was landed on Whale Beach,
 and whose jaws, being now my gateway, will last for ages after my
 coffin shall have passed beneath them. Thence it is an easy digression
 to the halibut--scarcely smaller than the whale--which ran out six
 codlines and hauled my dory to the mouth of Boston harbor before I
 could touch him with the gaff.
 
 If melancholy accidents be the theme of conversation, I tell how a
 friend of mine was taken out of his boat by an enormous shark, and the
 sad, true tale of a young man on the eve of marriage who had been nine
 days missing, when his drowned body floated into the very pathway on
 Marble-head Neck that had often led him to the dwelling of his bride,
 as if the dripping corpse would have come where the mourner was. With
 such awful fidelity did that lover return to fulfil his vows! Another
--**--**--
 steal a kiss from the mountain-maid at parting. It was one of those
 primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging,
 but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price. When the footsteps
 were heard, therefore, between the outer door and the inner one, the
 whole family rose up, grandmother, children and all, as if about to
 welcome some one who belonged to them, and whose fate was linked with
 theirs.
 
 The door was opened by a young man. His face at first wore the
 melancholy expression, almost despondency, of one who travels a wild
 and bleak road at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened up when he
 saw the kindly warmth of his reception. He felt his heart spring
 forward to meet them all, from the old woman who wiped a chair with
 her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him. One
 glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent
 familiarity with the eldest daughter.
 
 "Ah! this fire is the right thing," cried he, "especially when there
 is such a pleasant circle round it. I am quite benumbed, for the Notch
 is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows; it has blown a
 terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett."
 
 "Then you are going toward Vermont?" said the master of the house as
 he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man's shoulders.
 
 "Yes, to Burlington, and far enough beyond," replied he. "I meant to
 have been at Ethan Crawford's to-night, but a pedestrian lingers along
 such a road as this. It is no matter; for when I saw this good fire
 and all your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had kindled it on
 purpose for me and were waiting my arrival. So I shall sit down among
--**--**--
 the ocean, that wide and nameless sepulchre?"
 
 For a moment the old woman's ghastly conception so engrossed the minds
 of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night, rising like the roar
 of a blast, had grown broad, deep and terrible before the fated group
 were conscious of it. The house and all within it trembled; the
 foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken, as if this awful sound
 were the peal of the last trump. Young and old exchanged one wild
 glance and remained an instant pale, affrighted, without utterance or
 power to move. Then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all
 their lips:
 
 "The slide! The slide!"
 
 The simplest words must intimate, but not portray, the unutterable
 horror of the catastrophe. The victims rushed from their cottage and
 sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot, where, in
 contemplation of such an emergency, a sort of barrier had been reared.
 Alas! they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway
 of destruction. Down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract
 of ruin. Just before it reached the house the stream broke into two
 branches, shivered not a window there, but overwhelmed the whole
 vicinity, blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its
 dreadful course. Long ere the thunder of that great slide had ceased
 to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the
 victims were at peace. Their bodies were never found.
 
 The next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage
 chimney up the mountain-side. Within, the fire was yet smouldering on
 the hearth, and the chairs in a circle round it, as if the inhabitants
 had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would
 shortly return to thank Heaven for their miraculous escape. All had
--**--**--
 some very desirable thing--the consummation of some long-sought
 good--from her kind offices. A few dismal characters there may be here
 and there about the world who have so often been trifled with by young
 maidens as promising as she that they have now ceased to pin any faith
 upon the skirts of the New Year. But, for my own part, I have great
 faith in her, and, should I live to see fifty more such, still from
 each of those successive sisters I shall reckon upon receiving
 something that will be worth living for.
 
 The New Year--for this young maiden was no less a personage--carried
 all her goods and chattels in a basket of no great size or weight,
 which hung upon her arm. She greeted the disconsolate Old Year with
 great affection, and sat down beside her on the steps of the
 city-hall, waiting for the signal to begin her rambles through the
 world. The two were own sisters, being both granddaughters of Time,
 and, though one looked so much older than the other, it was rather
 owing to hardships and trouble than to age, since there was but a
 twelvemonth's difference between them.
 
 "Well, my dear sister," said the New Year, after the first
 salutations, "you look almost tired to death. What have you been about
 during your sojourn in this part of infinite space?"
 
 "Oh, I have it all recorded here in my book of chronicles," answered
 the Old Year, in a heavy tone. "There is nothing that would amuse you,
 and you will soon get sufficient knowledge of such matters from your
 own personal experience. It is but tiresome reading."
 
 Nevertheless, she turned over the leaves of the folio and glanced at
 them by the light of the moon, feeling an irresistible spell of
 interest in her own biography, although its incidents were remembered
--**--**--
 means of happiness you please, they will still be complaining, still
 craving what it is not in your power to give, still looking forward to
 some other year for the accomplishment of projects which ought never
 to have been formed, and which, if successful, would only provide new
 occasions of discontent. If these ridiculous people ever see anything
 tolerable in you, it will be after you are gone for ever."
 
 "But I," cried the fresh-hearted New Year--"I shall try to leave men
 wiser than I find them. I will offer them freely whatever good gifts
 Providence permits me to distribute, and will tell them to be thankful
 for what they have and humbly hopeful for more; and surely, if they
 are not absolute fools, they will condescend to be happy, and will
 allow me to be a happy year. For my happiness must depend on them."
 
 "Alas for you, then, my poor sister!" said the Old Year, sighing, as
 she uplifted her burden. "We grandchildren of Time are born to
 trouble. Happiness, they say, dwells in the mansions of eternity, but
 we can only lead mortals thither step by step with reluctant
 murmurings, and ourselves must perish on the threshold. But hark! my
 task is done."
 
 The clock in the tall steeple of Dr. Emerson's church struck twelve;
 there was a response from Dr. Flint's, in the opposite quarter of the
 city; and while the strokes were yet dropping into the air the Old
 Year either flitted or faded away, and not the wisdom and might of
 angels, to say nothing of the remorseful yearnings of the millions who
 had used her ill, could have prevailed with that departed year to
 return one step. But she, in the company of Time and all her kindred,
 must hereafter hold a reckoning with mankind. So shall it be,
