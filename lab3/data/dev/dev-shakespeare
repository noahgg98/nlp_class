--**--**--
     And so should you.
   ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
     Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
     Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
     Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
     Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
     Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
     Being prepar'd for land.
   ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
   ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
     The absolute soldiership you have by land;
     Distract your army, which doth most consist
     Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
     Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
     The way which promises assurance; and
     Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
     From firm security.
   ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
   CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
   ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
     And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
     Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
     We then can do't at land.
 
                        Enter a MESSENGER
 
     Thy business?
   MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
     Caesar has taken Toryne.
   ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
     Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
     Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
     And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
     Away, my Thetis!
 
                        Enter a SOLDIER
 
     How now, worthy soldier?
   SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
     Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
     This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
     And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
     Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
     And fighting foot to foot.
   ANTONY. Well, well- away.
                          Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS
   SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
   CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
     Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
     And we are women's men.
--**--**--
   CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
     Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
     That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT
   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
     The loyalty well held to fools does make
     Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
     To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
     Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
     And earns a place i' th' story.
 
                        Enter THYREUS
 
   CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?
   THYREUS. Hear it apart.
   CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.
   THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
   ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
     Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
     Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
     Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
   THYREUS. So.
     Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
     Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
     Further than he is Caesar.
   CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!
   THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony
     As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
   CLEOPATRA. O!
   THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
     Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
     Not as deserv'd.
   CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows
     What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
     But conquer'd merely.
   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,
     I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
     That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
     Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit
   THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar
     What you require of him? For he partly begs
     To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
     That of his fortunes you should make a staff
     To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
     To hear from me you had left Antony,
     And put yourself under his shroud,
--**--**--
     Together with my brave Egyptians all,
     By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
     Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
     Have buried them for prey.
   ANTONY. I am satisfied.
     Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
     I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
     Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
     Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
     Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
     If from the field I shall return once more
     To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
     I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
     There's hope in't yet.
   CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord!
   ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
     And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
     Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
     Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
     And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
     Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
     All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
     Let's mock the midnight bell.
   CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.
     I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
     Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
   ANTONY. We will yet do well.
   CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.
   ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
     The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
     There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
     I'll make death love me; for I will contend
     Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
   ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
     Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
     The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
     A diminution in our captain's brain
     Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
--**--**--
     And feel I am so most. O Antony,
     Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
     My better service, when my turpitude
     Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
     If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
     Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
     I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
     Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
     My latter part of life.                                 Exit

              Field of battle between the camps
 
          Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA
                         and others
 
   AGRIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
     Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
     Exceeds what we expected.                             Exeunt
 
           Alarums. Enter ANTONY, and SCARUS wounded
 
   SCARUS. O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
     Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
     With clouts about their heads.
   ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
   SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T,
     But now 'tis made an H.
   ANTONY. They do retire.
   SCARUS. We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
     Room for six scotches more.
 
                         Enter EROS
 
   EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
     For a fair victory.
   SCARUS. Let us score their backs
     And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
     'Tis sport to maul a runner.
   ANTONY. I will reward thee
     Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
     For thy good valour. Come thee on.
     SCARUS. I'll halt after.                              Exeunt

         Alarum. Enter ANTONY, again in a march; SCARUS
                         with others
 
   ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
     And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
     Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
     That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
     For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
--**--**--
     To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
     Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
     His baseness that ensued?
   EROS. I would not see't.
   ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
     Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
     Most useful for thy country.
   EROS. O, sir, pardon me!
   ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
     To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
     Or thy precedent services are all
     But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
   EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance,
     Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
   ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
   EROS. My sword is drawn.
   ANTONY. Then let it do at once
     The thing why thou hast drawn it.
   EROS. My dear master,
     My captain and my emperor, let me say,
     Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
   ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
   EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
   ANTONY. Now, Eros.
   EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
     Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself
   ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
     Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
     I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
     Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
     A nobleness in record. But I will be
     A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
     As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
     Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
                                           [Falling on his sword]
     I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
     The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
 
                   Enter DERCETAS and a guard
 
   FIRST GUARD. What's the noise?
   ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
     Of what I have begun.
   SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n.
   FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.
--**--**--
   CLEOPATRA. No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
     By such poor passion as the maid that milks
     And does the meanest chares. It were for me
     To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
     To tell them that this world did equal theirs
     Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
     Patience is sottish, and impatience does
     Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
     To rush into the secret house of death
     Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
     What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
     My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
     Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
     We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
     Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
     And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
     This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
     Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
     But resolution and the briefest end.
                    Exeunt; those above hearing off ANTONY'S body
 
 ACT_5|SC_1
                        ACT V. SCENE I.
                   Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp
 
       Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS,
           PROCULEIUS, and others, his Council of War
 
   CAESAR. Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
     Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
     The pauses that he makes.
   DOLABELLA. Caesar, I shall.                               Exit
 
              Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
 
   CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
     Appear thus to us?
   DERCETAS. I am call'd Dercetas;
     Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
     Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
     He was my master, and I wore my life
     To spend upon his haters. If thou please
     To take me to thee, as I was to him
     I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
     I yield thee up my life.
   CAESAR. What is't thou say'st?
--**--**--
     But if there be nor ever were one such,
     It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
     To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
     An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
     Condemning shadows quite.
   DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.
     Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
     As answering to the weight. Would I might never
     O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
     By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
     My very heart at root.
   CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.
     Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
   DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
   CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.
   DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-
   CLEOPATRA. He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
   DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
                               [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
 
        Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
                      and others of his train
 
   CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?
   DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
   CAESAR. Arise, you shall not kneel.
     I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
   CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods
     Will have it thus; my master and my lord
     I must obey.
   CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts.
     The record of what injuries you did us,
     Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
     As things but done by chance.
   CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world,
     I cannot project mine own cause so well
     To make it clear, but do confess I have
     Been laden with like frailties which before
     Have often sham'd our sex.
   CAESAR. Cleopatra, know
     We will extenuate rather than enforce.
     If you apply yourself to our intents-
     Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
     A benefit in this change; but if you seek
     To lay on me a cruelty by taking
     Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
--**--**--
     This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
     I found her trimming up the diadem
     On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
     And on the sudden dropp'd.
   CAESAR. O noble weakness!
     If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
     By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
     As she would catch another Antony
     In her strong toil of grace.
   DOLABELLA. Here on her breast
     There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
     The like is on her arm.
   FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
     Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
     Upon the caves of Nile.
   CAESAR. Most probable
     That so she died; for her physician tells me
     She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
     Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
     And bear her women from the monument.
     She shall be buried by her Antony;
     No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
     A pair so famous. High events as these
     Strike those that make them; and their story is
     No less in pity than his glory which
     Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
     In solemn show attend this funeral,
     And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
     High order in this great solemnity.                   Exeunt

     as mine is to thee.
   ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
     rejoice in yours.
   CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
     have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
     he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
     again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
     oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
     Rose, be merry.
   ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
     Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
   CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
     in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
     of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
   ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
   CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
     wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
   ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
     misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
     gifts to women.
   CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
     honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
     ill-favouredly.
   ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
     Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
     Nature.
 
                          Enter TOUCHSTONE
 
   CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
     Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
     flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
     the argument?
   ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
     Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.

     makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
 
                            Enter LE BEAU
 
   ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.
   CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
   ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
   CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
     Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
   LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
   CELIA. Sport! of what colour?
   LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
   ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
   TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
   CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
   ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
   LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
     wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
   ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
   LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
     ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
     here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
   CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
   LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
   CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
   LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
   ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
     these presents'-
   LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
     wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
     his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
     the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
     their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
--**--**--
   CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.
   FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
     And get you from our court.
   ROSALIND. Me, uncle?
   FREDERICK. You, cousin.
     Within these ten days if that thou beest found
     So near our public court as twenty miles,
     Thou diest for it.
   ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
     Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
     If with myself I hold intelligence,
     Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
     If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
     As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
     Never so much as in a thought unborn
     Did I offend your Highness.
   FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
     If their purgation did consist in words,
     They are as innocent as grace itself.
     Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
   ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
     Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
   FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
   ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
     So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
     Treason is not inherited, my lord;
     Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
     What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
     Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
     To think my poverty is treacherous.
   CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
   FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
     Else had she with her father rang'd along.
   CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
     It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
     I was too young that time to value her,
     But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
     Why so am I: we still have slept together,
     Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
     And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
--**--**--
     Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
     Yet not the son; I will not call him son
     Of him I was about to call his father-
     Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
     To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
     And you within it. If he fail of that,
     He will have other means to cut you off;
     I overheard him and his practices.
     This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
     Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
   ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
   ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
   ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
     Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
     A thievish living on the common road?
     This I must do, or know not what to do;
     Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
     I rather will subject me to the malice
     Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
   ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
     The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
     Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
     When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
     And unregarded age in corners thrown.
     Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
     Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
     Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
     All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
     Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
     For in my youth I never did apply
     Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
     Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
     The means of weakness and debility;
     Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
     Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
     I'll do the service of a younger man
--**--**--
            And loves to live i' th' sun,
            Seeking the food he eats,
            And pleas'd with what he gets,
          Come hither, come hither, come hither.
            Here shall he see
            No enemy
            But winter and rough weather.
 
   JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
     despite of my invention.
   AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
   JAQUES. Thus it goes:
 
              If it do come to pass
              That any man turn ass,
              Leaving his wealth and ease
              A stubborn will to please,
            Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
              Here shall he see
              Gross fools as he,
              An if he will come to me.
 
   AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
   JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll
     go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
     first-born of Egypt.
   AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
                                                 Exeunt severally
 
 
 
 
 SCENE VI.
 The forest
 
 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
 
   ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
     I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
   ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
     little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
     forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
     bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
     powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
     arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
     not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
     diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
     thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
     liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
--**--**--
   ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
  Exit
   DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
     This wide and universal theatre
     Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
     Wherein we play in.
   JAQUES. All the world's a stage,
     And all the men and women merely players;
     They have their exits and their entrances;
     And one man in his time plays many parts,
     His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
     Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
     Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
     And shining morning face, creeping like snail
     Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
     Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
     Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
     Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
     Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
     Seeking the bubble reputation
     Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
     In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
     With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
     Full of wise saws and modern instances;
     And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
     Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
     With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
     His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
     For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
     Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
     And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
     That ends this strange eventful history,
     Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
     Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
 
                   Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
 
   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
     And let him feed.
   ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.
   ADAM. So had you need;
     I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
     As yet to question you about your fortunes.
--**--**--
            That the streching of a span
              Buckles in his sum of age;
            Some, of violated vows
              'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
            But upon the fairest boughs,
              Or at every sentence end,
            Will I Rosalinda write,
              Teaching all that read to know
            The quintessence of every sprite
              Heaven would in little show.
            Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
              That one body should be fill'd
            With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
              Nature presently distill'd
            Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
              Cleopatra's majesty,
            Atalanta's better part,
              Sad Lucretia's modesty.
            Thus Rosalinde of many parts
              By heavenly synod was devis'd,
            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
              To have the touches dearest priz'd.
            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
            And I to live and die her slave.'
   ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
     you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
     patience, good people.'
   CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
     him, sirrah.
   TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
     though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
                                      Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
   CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
   ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
     had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
   CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
   ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
     without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
   CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
     hang'd and carved upon these trees?
   ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
     came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
     berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I
--**--**--
     the ground.
   CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
     unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
   ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
   CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
     of tune.
   ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
     Sweet, say on.
   CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
 
                    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
 
   ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
   JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
     lief have been myself alone.
   ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
     for your society.
   JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
   ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
   JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
     their barks.
   ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
     ill-favouredly.
   JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
   ORLANDO. Yes, just.
   JAQUES. I do not like her name.
   ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
     christen'd.
   JAQUES. What stature is she of?
   ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.
   JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
     acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
   ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
     you have studied your questions.
   JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
     heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
     our mistress the world, and all our misery.
   ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
     whom I know most faults.
   JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
--**--**--
     time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
     changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
     shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
     passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
     women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
     him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
     weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
     mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
     forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
     merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
     upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
     that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
   ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
   ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
     come every day to my cote and woo me.
   ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
   ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
     you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
   ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
   ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
     go?                                                   Exeunt
 
 
 
 
 SCENE III.
 The forest
 
 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
 
   TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
     Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
     content you?
   AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
   TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
     capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
   JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
--**--**--
                            Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
   MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
     shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit
 
 
 
 
 SCENE IV.
 The forest
 
 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
 
   ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
   CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
     do not become a man.
   ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
   CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
   ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
   CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.
     Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
   ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
   CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
   ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
     holy bread.
   CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
     winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
     chastity is in them.
   ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
     comes not?
   CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
   ROSALIND. Do you think so?
   CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
     for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
     goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
   ROSALIND. Not true in love?
   CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
   ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
   CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
     stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
     of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
     your father.
   ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
     He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
--**--**--
     'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
     Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
     That can entame my spirits to your worship.
     You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
     Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
     You are a thousand times a properer man
     Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
     That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
     'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
     And out of you she sees herself more proper
     Than any of her lineaments can show her.
     But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
     And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
     For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
     Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
     Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
     Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
     So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
   PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
     I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
   ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
     in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
     with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
     you so upon me?
   PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
   ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
     For I am falser than vows made in wine;
     Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
     'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
     Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
     Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
     And be not proud; though all the world could see,
     None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
--**--**--
     are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
     eaten them, but not for love.
   ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
     protest, her frown might kill me.
   ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
     will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me
     what you will, I will grant it.
   ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
   ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
   ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
   ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
   ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
   ROSALIND. Are you not good?
   ORLANDO. I hope so.
   ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
     sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
     Orlando. What do you say, sister?
   ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
   CELIA. I cannot say the words.
   ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
   CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
   ORLANDO. I will.
   ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
   ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
   ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
   ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
   ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
     Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
     and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
   ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
   ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
     possess'd her.
   ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
   ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
     April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
     they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
--**--**--
 
   ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
     And here much Orlando!
   CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
     ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
     comes here.
 
                       Enter SILVIUS
 
   SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
     My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
     I know not the contents; but, as I guess
     By the stern brow and waspish action
     Which she did use as she was writing of it,
     It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
     I am but as a guiltless messenger.
   ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
     And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
     She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
     She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
     Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
     Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
     Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
     This is a letter of your own device.
   SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
     Phebe did write it.
   ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
     And turn'd into the extremity of love.
     I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
     A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
     That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
     She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
     I say she never did invent this letter:
     This is a man's invention, and his hand.
   SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
   ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
     A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
     Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
     Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
     Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
     Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
--**--**--
     with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
     If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
     it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I
     know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
     impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
     her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
     danger.
   ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
   ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
     am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
     friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
     Rosalind, if you will.
 
                      Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
 
     Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
   PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
     To show the letter that I writ to you.
   ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
     To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
     You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
     Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
   PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
     And so am I for Phebe.
   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
     And so am I for Phebe.
   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
     All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
     All adoration, duty, and observance,
     All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
     All purity, all trial, all obedience;
--**--**--
   DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
     Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
   ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
     Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
     But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
     And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
     Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
     Whom he reports to be a great magician,
     Obscured in the circle of this forest.
 
                     Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
 
   JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
     coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
     in all tongues are call'd fools.
   TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
   JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
     gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
      courtier, he swears.
   TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
     I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
     politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
     three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
     one.
   JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
   TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
     seventh cause.
   JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
   DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
   TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
     here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
     and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
     poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
     poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
     honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
--**--**--
   Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
   Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
   I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
   My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
   Made daily motions for our home return;
   Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
   We came aboard.
   A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
   Before the always-wind-obeying deep
   Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
   But longer did we not retain much hope,
   For what obscured light the heavens did grant
   Did but convey unto our fearful minds
   A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
   Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
   Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
   Weeping before for what she saw must come,
   And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
   That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
   Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
   And this it was, for other means was none:
   The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
   And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
   My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
   Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
   Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
   To him one of the other twins was bound,
   Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
   The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
   Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
   Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
   And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
   Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
   At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
   Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
   And, by the benefit of his wished light,
   The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
   Two ships from far making amain to us-
   Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
   But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
   Gather the sequel by that went before.
--**--**--
   Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
   If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
   Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
   Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
   That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
   What ruins are in me that can be found
   By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
   Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
   A sunny look of his would soon repair.
   But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
   And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
 LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
 ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
   I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
   Or else what lets it but he would be here?
   Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
   Would that alone a love he would detain,
   So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
   I see the jewel best enamelled
   Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
   That others touch and, often touching, will
   Where gold; and no man that hath a name
   By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
   Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
   I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
 LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

 SCENE 2
 
 The mart
 
 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
 
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
   Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
   Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
   By computation and mine host's report
   I could not speak with Dromio since at first
   I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
 
 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 
   How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?
   As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
   You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
   Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
--**--**--
   given them in wit.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
   hath more hair than wit.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the
   wit to lose his hair.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
   men plain dealers without wit.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
   yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in
   tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his
   porridge.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
   is no time for all things.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
   hair lost by nature.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
   there is no time to recover.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
   and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
   soft, who wafts us yonder?
 
 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
 
 ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
   Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
   I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
   The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
   That never words were music to thine ear,
   That never object pleasing in thine eye,
   That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
   That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
   Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
--**--**--
   Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
   Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
   When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?
   My master stays in the street.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
     lest he catch cold on's feet.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when,
     an you'll tell me wherefore.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
     I have not din'd to-day.
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;
     come again when you may.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
     from the house I owe?
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,
     sir, and my name is Dromio.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
     office and my name!
   The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
   If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
   Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.
 
 Enter LUCE, within
 
 LUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.
 LUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
   And so tell your master.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!
   Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
 LUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell?
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
     -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
 LUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.
--**--**--
 
 ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
 ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
   I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
   The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
 ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
 ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
   Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
   And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
   And then receive my money for the chain.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
   For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
 ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
 <Exit
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
   But this I think, there's no man is so vain
   That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
   I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
   When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
   I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
   If any ship put out, then straight away.
 <Exit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ACT IV. SCENE 1
 
 A public place
 
 Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER
 
 SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
   And since I have not much importun'd you;
   Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
   To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
   Therefore make present satisfaction,
   Or I'll attach you by this officer.
 ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
   Is growing to me by Antipholus;
   And in the instant that I met with you
   He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
--**--**--
 ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
 ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
   Consider how it stands upon my credit.
 SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
 OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
 ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
   Either consent to pay this sum for me,
   Or I attach you by this officer.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
   Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.
 ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
   I would not spare my brother in this case,
   If he should scorn me so apparently.
 OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
   But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
   As all the metal in your shop will answer.
 ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
   To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
 
 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay
 
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum
   That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
   And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
   I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
   The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.
   The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
   Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an
   But for their owner, master, and yourself.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
   What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
   And told thee to what purpose and what end.
--**--**--
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,
   That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
 ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
 PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
   And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
 ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
   By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,
   But surely, master, not a rag of money.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
 ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
 LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness
   That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
 PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
   I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
   They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
   And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
 ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;
   But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
 ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
   And art confederate with a damned pack
   To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
   But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
   That would behold in me this shameful sport.
--**--**--
   The venom clamours of a jealous woman
   Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
   It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
   And thereof comes it that his head is light.
   Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
   Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
   Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
   And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
   Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
   Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
   But moody and dull melancholy,
   Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
   And at her heels a huge infectious troop
   Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
   In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
   To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
   The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits
   Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
 LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,
   When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
   Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?
 ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
   Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.
 ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
 ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
 ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
   And it shall privilege him from your hands
   Till I have brought him to his wits again,
   Or lose my labour in assaying it.
 ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
   Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
   And will have no attorney but myself;
   And therefore let me have him home with me.
 ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir
   Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
   With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
   To make of him a formal man again.
   It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
--**--**--
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
   And Dromio my man did bring them me.
   I see we still did meet each other's man,
   And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
   And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
 DUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
 COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
   good cheer.
 ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
   To go with us into the abbey here,
   And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
   And all that are assembled in this place
   That by this sympathized one day's error
   Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
   And we shall make full satisfaction.
   Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
   Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
   My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
   The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
   And you the calendars of their nativity,
   Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
   After so long grief, such nativity!
 DUKE. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
 <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF
 EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
   Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.
   Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master's house,
--**--**--
     And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
     Deserves your hate; and your affections are
     A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
     Which would increase his evil. He that depends
     Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
     And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
     With every minute you do change a mind
     And call him noble that was now your hate,
     Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
     That in these several places of the city
     You cry against the noble Senate, who,
     Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
     Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
   MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
     The city is well stor'd.
   MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!
     They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
     What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
     Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
     Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
     And feebling such as stand not in their liking
     Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
     Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
     And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
     With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
     As I could pick my lance.
   MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
     For though abundantly they lack discretion,
     Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
     What says the other troop?
   MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
     They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
     That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
     That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
     Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
     They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
     And a petition granted them- a strange one,
     To break the heart of generosity
